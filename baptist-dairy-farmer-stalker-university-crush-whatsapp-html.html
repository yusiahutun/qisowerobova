He is now in a relationship with another woman.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Miss Knowles, who works as a Farm Business Consultant said she lives in fear of seeing Aidley around the village where she lives.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She added: 'My partner was away for a weekend, so I asked my friend to be on standby in case Isaac came down to try and enter the house to hang around. He knows where I live. I am terrified of him coming to my address.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My friend Jack gladly obliged. He knows the stress it has caused me. To this day I have remained worried about the future and having to see Isaac. I am very worried about him doing this to somebody else.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It took me five years to work out that this was not right.

'Throughout the whole time in university I had been in a relationship with someone else. I had never been in a relationship with Isaac and he was fully aware of my circumstances.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I never gave Isaac the impression that there would be any more between us other than a friendship at most. When we left university we did not see each other much.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Miss Knowles said that initially Aidley would send occasional texts and sometimes picture of puppies or piglets from the farm and sometimes depicted what a good wife she would be, which she though she thought was odd but believed was innocent.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But after four or five years the messages started to become more frequent, she said, going from one per month to five or six per month, with some phone calls and videos.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I never answered the phone calls,' she said, 'I explained that I was still in a relationship with my partner Olly.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Miss Knowles said that she sought medical help for depression and while acknowledging it was not entirely related to Aidley's harassment, it was a significant factor.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It had a large part to play in my low moods and stress,' she said, 'It was putting a strain on my relationship. It was a source of multiple arguments between my partner and I. He thought I should block him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I am friends with the same group of friends and did not want to make the situation awkward. After many months of feeling harassed I began swearing in the texts and telling him I did not want him to contact me.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He did not seem to care for my stress or anxiety issues or read the messages I was sending. He proceeded to tell me he was going to see me soon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That scared me so much.

The defendant replied that he understood but subsequently during April 2022 to January 2023, there were nine messages sent and WhatsApp pictures were sent of the defendant himself and messages wishing Miss Knowles a happy birthday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She did not reply but again in January a message was sent asking Miss Knowles to go for a walk. At this time, she confirms that she is upset and told him again that she has a boyfriend and then the messages need to stop.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The messages continued. The defendant makes further contact with Miss Knowles about her profile picture on a social media website. She doesn't reply but it continued in March and April. With the defendant continuing to message her, Miss Knowles confirms at this point that she will be contacting police.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'During March and April there were 12 WhatsApp messages received by Miss Knowles, some of them saying 'I love you always'. The defendant also attempted to contact her by telephone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There has been significant psychological harm and stress caused to the victim. She has been caused to make lifestyle changes to avoid contact with the defendant. She requested a friend to come and stay when her partner was away.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There has been a persistent action by the defendant over a prolonged period.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Aidley had no previous convictions. Defence solicitor Catherine Higham said: 'The offence arises from him not knowing where the boundaries were, or respecting the boundaries that were put in place by the complainant.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He understands what has happened and understands the effects on the victim..'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sentencing Aidley, JP Jeffrey Langham said: 'This is not a great set of circumstances that led you to be here today.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But we have given you some credit for your guilty plea. The credit for that is reflected in the fact that we are not sending this matter to the crown court for sentencing which has greater sentencing powers than we do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You are not to approach the victim for 10 years. You are not to approach or contact Miss Isabella Knowles by any means including by social media.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc4WRcm1raV%2BXrrHAyKyrZpyRnr%2B6ecWaqaadomLAta3LpJyrZaWjtrex0aygrbFdmL%2B2v8dmrqGZpKiusbyNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbaptist-dairy-farmer-stalker-university-crush-whatsapp-html.html&text=Strict%20Baptist%20dairy%20farmer%2c%2027%2c%20stalked%20his%20university%20crush%20over%20WhatsApp%20for%20five%20years%20-%20forcing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbaptist-dairy-farmer-stalker-university-crush-whatsapp-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbaptist-dairy-farmer-stalker-university-crush-whatsapp-html.html&title=Strict%20Baptist%20dairy%20farmer%2c%2027%2c%20stalked%20his%20university%20crush%20over%20WhatsApp%20for%20five%20years%20-%20forcing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbaptist-dairy-farmer-stalker-university-crush-whatsapp-html.html&title=Strict%20Baptist%20dairy%20farmer%2c%2027%2c%20stalked%20his%20university%20crush%20over%20WhatsApp%20for%20five%20years%20-%20forcing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbaptist-dairy-farmer-stalker-university-crush-whatsapp-html.html&title=Strict%20Baptist%20dairy%20farmer%2c%2027%2c%20stalked%20his%20university%20crush%20over%20WhatsApp%20for%20five%20years%20-%20forcing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbaptist-dairy-farmer-stalker-university-crush-whatsapp-html.html&description=Strict%20Baptist%20dairy%20farmer%2c%2027%2c%20stalked%20his%20university%20crush%20over%20WhatsApp%20for%20five%20years%20-%20forcing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./boxing-news-sylvester-stallone-once-detailed-his-experience-of-sparring-with-a-man-who-would-demolish-him-in-11-seconds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sylvester Stallone Once Detailed His Experience of Sparring With a Man WhoWould Demolish Him ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lily-james-best-red-carpet-moments-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lily James' best red carpet moments of all time">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
