An airline’s definition of damage, backed by the US Department of transport, may differ significantly from a passenger’s definition. Normal wear and tear, including scratches, scuff marks, stains, dents and dirt, are not covered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every airline’s damaged bag policy has a disclaimer about normal wear and tear. And it applies even if you bought the suitcase the night before your flight or are checking in a designer bag.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you have a Louis Vuitton [bag] and it goes through the [conveyor] belt system, it is not white glove service,’’ said Lisa Ouimette, an analyst in American Airlines’ central baggage services office. “These are belt loaders. If you have a brand new bag, expect it to have normal wear and tear.’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Airlines also reserve the right to deny claims to passengers with damage caused by overstuffed bags, such as broken zips, as well as poor-quality bags, and bags that were already damaged when checked in.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So what is covered?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Damage to luggage components including wheels, handles, straps and other glaring problems, such as holes or a cracked hardside bag, are covered. The latter is a big problem in cold weather, Ouimette said. (So are removable straps, which regularly get stuck in the bag loading systems, so take them off, she said.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We anticipate damage and when it does happen, we have a plan in place to take care of our customers,’’ she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Passenger rights if an airline damages your bag</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2019/01/11/59537c48-131d-11e9-bd68-61a0d0b9ce58_972x_161655.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than 87 per cent of US travellers don’t file claims against airlines following an issue with lost, damaged or delayed luggage, according to a survey earlier this year by AirHelp, a service that helps passengers get compensation for claims against airlines. The three main reasons: They didn’t think they would be entitled to compensation, they were not aware of their rights, and they did not know how to file a claim.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Airlines are responsible for repairing or reimbursing a passenger for damaged baggage and/or its contents when the damage occurs while the bag is under the airline’s control, according to the US Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Aviation Consumer Protection division.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cheapest option for airlines is a bag repair. Many use Dallas-based Rynn’s Luggage, which bills itself as the largest airline luggage repair and replacement service in the country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If a bag cannot be repaired, it will be replaced with a similar bag or passengers will be reimbursed. The reimbursement is based on the value of the bag and its depreciation, the DOT says, subject to liability limits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For flights within the United States, the maximum liability for a lost, delayed or damaged bag is US$3,500. The limit on international flights, per the Montreal Convention, is about US$1,600, the agency says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Airlines are free to pay more but there is no requirement to do so, according to the DOT.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That doesn’t mean you’re going to get US$3,500 or anything close to it if a wheel fell off your bag or your handle was destroyed. (The higher limits generally apply to a lost suitcase full of pricey personal belongings.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My suitcase wasn’t new and had plenty of scuffs, but the broken retractable handle was clearly a big problem. I worried that Delta Air Lines, which I was flying the next day out of Dallas, wouldn’t accept it, or would have me sign a waiver absolving them of any liability should it get further damaged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Southwest baggage representatives in Dallas were friendly and apologetic and didn’t doubt I needed a new bag. But they were clearly trying to limit their liability. (I never identify myself as a travel reporter for fear of getting special treatment, a violation of our ethics policy.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2019/01/11/9f49349a-131d-11e9-bd68-61a0d0b9ce58_972x_161655.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They asked how old my bag was, where I bought it, and how much I paid for it. They took photos and went to a back room computer to search for a similar bag online. They couldn’t find one, or only found heavily discounted bags. I didn’t recall how much my bag was or where I bought it but estimated it at between US$150 and US$200. A repair never came up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then, in a move that surprised me, they wheeled out a couple new bags about the same size as my bag. One was a hardside bag, the other a traditional suitcase, and both had spinner wheels and a retractable handle, like mine. The hardside bag wouldn’t fit all of my stuff and both bags looked relatively cheap, so I initially passed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">American’s Ouimette said airlines keep so-called stock bags on hand for cases where passengers immediately need a new bag. She ordered a bunch for American for the busy holiday season. Many passengers love them because their damaged bag is older and they are thrilled to get a new one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was pickier and wanted something decent for the hassle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Southwest said they would reimburse me if I bought a new bag and brought a receipt for a similar bag on my way out of Dallas the next morning. I didn’t have time to shop during my 24-hour visit and needed a suitcase, so eventually decided to take them up on the stock bag.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the middle of the baggage claim office, I unpacked my broken bag and transferred everything to the new softside bag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2019/01/11/c7265a7e-131d-11e9-bd68-61a0d0b9ce58_1320x770_161655.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I wheeled it out of the office and into the corridor heading to the airport’s Uber pick-up area. I didn’t make it. The wheels kept circling, sending me a couple steps back for every step forward.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I fumbled my way back to the baggage claim office and told them the bag didn’t work. They were apologetic, again. I repacked everything into the broken bag and pushed it through the corridor and headed out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Southwest said they would reimburse me for whatever bag I bought, never setting a price limit. I didn’t buy one in Dallas; a generous friend I was staying with gave me a big suitcase they were no longer using.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just before Christmas, enticed by the offer of free expedited shipping, I bought a bag I’d had my eye on, a US$245 Away carry-on bag. It was nowhere near as big as the Kenneth Cole one Southwest broke, but my friend’s bag took care of my big-bag needs and I was in desperate need of a sturdy new carry-on bag.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My claim was finally resolved the day after Christmas in Phoenix. I landed at Sky Harbor International Airport after midnight and headed to the baggage claim office while waiting for bags to arrive after my flight from Providence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2019/01/11/0656a262-131e-11e9-bd68-61a0d0b9ce58_972x_161655.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I submitted my receipt for US$260, which included taxes. It took the agents time to find my claim because I didn’t have my “damage incident report’’ and they were having computer issues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A supervisor offered US$200, a figure noted in my report by the Dallas agents. I told her they said to buy any bag and bring the receipt, no money figure mentioned, due to my hassles with the stock bag.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’ll split the difference, how’s that?’’ she asked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At 1am, I walked out of the office with a cheque for US$225.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">5 things to do if an airline damages your bag</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2019/01/11/f013e62c-131d-11e9-bd68-61a0d0b9ce58_972x_161655.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">1. Head to the baggage claim office immediately if possible. You have up to 24 hours to report a claim for domestic flights and seven days for international flights on most carriers, though policies vary by airline. Southwest and JetBlue require claims within four hours; Frontier, 12 hours. It’s easiest to do in person, having everything documented on-site instead of spending time on the phone and uploading claim documents online. Plus, you might be offered a replacement bag on the spot if you’re not picky about a new bag.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">2. Don’t rip off your baggage tags. The airline will need them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">3. Be calm and courteous. A banged-up bag is a bad way to begin or end a trip, but blasting the baggage claim representative for a missing wheel or hole in your bag isn’t going to help your claim or get it resolved more quickly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">4. Know the approximate value of your bag and where you bought it to give you some negotiating leverage in case of reimbursement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">5. Jot down names of airline representatives and details discussed and stay on top of the claims process if it’s not resolved immediately. Airlines issue a claim number and updates can be found online. Not getting the answers you want? Ask to talk to someone in the airport office where you submitted the claim or a representative in the airline’s central baggage services office.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
