Cast and crew members reported mysterious occurrences while filming, like light bulbs bursting without explanation and the sensation of someone tugging at their clothes.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>The spooky series ran for five seasons before its cancellation in 2010. However, Hewitt recently said she’d love to see a Ghost Whisperer reboot someday. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Melinda Gordon was hands down one of my favorite characters I’ve ever played, if not my favorite. I would love to do it</a>,” she recently said on the Inside of You podcast.</p><p>Until that happens, here’s what the Ghost Whisperer cast is up to these days.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ghost Whisperer cast then and now</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jennifer Love Hewitt as Melinda Gordon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-08T122929.550.png><p>After starring for two seasons on the Disney Channel show Kids Incorporated, Jennifer Love Hewitt shot to fame in the 90s with a recurring role on the TV show Party of Five and movie roles in I Know What You Did Last Summer and Can’t Hardly Wait. Throughout the early 2000s, Hewitt continued to act in comedies like Heartbreakers, The Tuxedo, and a live-action Garfield movie.</p><p><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=#>‘Party of Five’ Cast Then and Now: Catch Up With the Salinger Siblings Today</a></p><p>In 2005, she returned to the small screen as Melinda in Ghost Whisperer. In addition to her lead role in the series, Hewitt also directed several episodes and was an executive producer during the show’s fifth and final season.</p><p>Since the show ended in 2010, Hewitt has continued to enjoy a prolific acting career, including a starring role in the Lifetime drama The Client List, where she met her husband, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Hallisay</a>. Hewitt followed that up with a recurring role on Criminal Minds, and she currently stars as emergency dispatcher Maddie Buckley on the police procedural 9-1-1.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Did you know?</h3><p>Hewitt has also enjoyed a successful music career. She released four studio albums — including 2002’s BareNaked, which hit #37 on the Billboard charts — and appears as a backup vocalist on Martika’s chart-topping 1989 single “Toy Soldiers.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>David Conrad as Jim Clancy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-08T123229.204.png><p>Before he was bitten by the acting bug, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Conrad</a> originally attended Brown University as a history major. After leaving Brown, he bounced between odd jobs before enrolling at the prestigious Juilliard School to study theater. But he dropped out during his final year, after he was offered the chance to star alongside Sigourney Weaver in the Showtime movie Snow White: A Tale of Terror.</p><p>From there, Conrad landed roles in the movie Under Heat, the TV series Relativity, and a regional production of the play Arcadia. In 1998, he made his Broadway debut in the play The Deep Blue Sea. Since then, his career has spanned the stage and screen — including roles in movies like Wedding Crashers and Men of Honor, and TV shows like Roswell and Boston Public.</p><p>In 2005, Conrad was cast as Melinda’s husband, Jim, on Ghost Whisperer, a role he portrayed for five seasons. After the show ended, Conrad made guest appearances on shows like CSI: Miami, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and Castle, and had a recurring role in the Marvel series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><p>In 2019, he returned to his Pittsburgh hometown to star in a production of the play <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Georgia McBride</a>. Most recently, he’s worked on the psychological thriller Basic Psych and the Lifetime original movie 12 Desperate Hours.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>‘Castle’ Cast Then and Now: Where the Stars Are Now And What They Think of a Return</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Did you know?</h3><p>Conrad’s great-grandfather, Frank Conrad, was an electrical engineer known as the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">father of radio broadcasting</a>” who helped to launch the first-ever commercial radio station.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aisha Tyler as Andrea Marino</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-08T123454.178.png><p>After working as a standup comic in the 90s, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aisha Tyler</a> launched her career in television with hosting gigs on the comedy show Talk Soup and the reality dating show The Fifth Wheel. She went on to play recurring roles on Friends, CSI and 24 before landing a role on Ghost Whisperer.</p><p>In the first season, Tyler plays Melinda’s best friend, coworker, and confidante Andrea — one of the few people who know about Melinda’s gift for talking to ghosts. But one of the show’s saddest moments came at the end of Season One, when — <strong>spoiler alert!</strong> — Andrea died in a plane crash.</p><p>After leaving the show, Tyler went on to have a thriving career in movies and television. She voiced the role of Lana Kane in the animated TV series Archer for 14 seasons, and co-hosted The Talk for six seasons, winning a Daytime Emmy in 2017. She’s also made guest appearances on shows like Boston Legal, Glee, and Modern Family, and has appeared in movies like The Santa Clause 3, Balls of Fury, and Bedtime Stories.</p><p>Currently, Tyler stars as Dr. Tara Lewis on Criminal Minds and is one of the hosts of the long-running improv comedy series Whose Line Is It Anyway?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Did you know?</h3><p>Tyler has portrayed a paleontologist, a psychologist, and an intelligence agent — but she’s also a brainiac in real life!

The buzz from that show led to small roles in movies like Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion and Scary Movie 3 and shows like Law & Order and Chicago Hope.</p><p>In 1997, Manheim landed her breakthrough role as passionate defense attorney Ellenor Frutt on The Practice. The show ran for eight seasons, with Manheim winning an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her performance.</p><p>Manheim went on to appear in shows like Will & Grace and Boston Public before joining the Ghost Whisperer cast in the second season. Manheim played Delia Banks, a local realtor and widow who takes a job at the antique store and forges a friendship with Melinda — though she’s initially skeptical of all things paranormal.</p><p>Since the show ended, Manheim’s career hasn’t slowed down. In 2012, she reunited with Hewitt in Jewtopia, a film adaptation of the popular off-Broadway play. More recently, Manheim had recurring roles in the crime dramas Person of Interest and Stumptown, and she currently stars as Lieutenant Kate Dixon on Law & Order.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did you know?</h2><p>Manheim is <a href=#>fluent in American Sign Language</a>.

His breakthrough role came in 1996, when he played cutthroat sports agent Bob Sugar in Jerry Maguire.</p><p>He went on to co-create the reality competition Last Comic Standing, which he hosted for three seasons, earning an Emmy nomination in 2003. But he declined to host the fourth season, and in 2005, he joined the Ghost Whisperer cast as Rick Payne, an anthropology professor who helps Melinda with her ghostly endeavors.</p><p>Mohr left Ghost Whisperer after the third season to take a starring role in the sitcom Gary Unmarried, but the show was cancelled after two seasons. He’s continued to appear in movies like Street Kings and Hereafter, and most recently appeared in Air, the 2023 sports drama based on the origin of the Air Jordan shoe line.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Did you know?</h3><p>An avid sports fan, Mohr briefly hosted his own ESPN show, Mohr Sports, in 2001 and later hosted the syndicated talk show Jay Mohr Sports on Fox Sports Radio.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Kennedy as Eli James</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-08T124329.175.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Kennedy</a> took a creative path to stardom. After a string of failed auditions, he ended up working as a telemarketer. Realizing he had a knack for sales, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">created a fake persona</a> — an agent named “Marty Power” — and began promoting himself to agents and managers.</p><p>The daring strategy worked, and Kennedy landed a lead role in the Scream film series along with memorable roles in Romeo + Juliet, Son of the Mask, and Malibu’s Most Wanted. He also hosted the hidden-camera prank show The Jamie Kennedy Experiment, which ran for three seasons.</p><p>After Mohr exited the Ghost Whisperer cast in 2008, Kennedy joined the show in Season Four as Eli James, a psychology professor who develops the ability to hear ghosts after a near-death experience and becomes Melinda’s new sidekick.</p><p>Kennedy went on to do voice work for the animated TV series The Cleveland Show and Fanboy & Chum Chum. In 2021, he appeared in the comedy-drama Last Call, and the following year he had a voice cameo in the fifth installment of the Scream franchise.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Did you know?</h3><p>Kennedy and his Ghost Whisperer co-star Hewitt began a romantic relationship while filming the show.

While enrolled in their conservatory program, he appeared in more than 16 theater productions and landed a role in a General Mills commercial.</p><p>Sanders made his movie debut in 2006 in the comedy Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, followed by a role in the drama Hounddog. In 2008, he joined the Ghost Whisperer cast as Ned Banks, Delia’s tech-savvy son who helps Melinda solve mysteries. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After the show ended, Sanders went on to star as Kyle Anderson in the sitcom Last Man Standing, which ran from 2011 to 2021. Most recently, he appeared in the 2022 HBO Max movie A Christmas Mystery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did you know?</h2><p>The role of Ned was originally portrayed by actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler Patrick Jones</a>, but Sanders — who’s six years older than Jones — was recast in the role for the third season so the writers could pursue more mature storylines.</p><p><strong>Want more of your favorite TV casts?
