On <i>Tanked</i>, Brett makes vital decisions (together with the company’s co-owner). His job description and role as the company’s image make his TV role exciting to watch.</p><p class=align-left>Brett works with his father, Irwin, Heather (sister), and Wayde (bother-in-law). In addition to job pressure, the four have another layer of relationship — family. While their main job is to run Acrylic Tank Manufacturing, they must protect their family ties.</p><p class=align-left>The TV star was married to Melissa Bradford for close to ten years. As Brett Raymer’s wife, she was involved in the formation of the company. However, after their divorce, Melisa left the company. Also, Melissa gave Brett custody of their two children.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Black Ink Crew cast net worth and salary per episode</p><p class=align-left>After divorcing Melissa, Brett spent more time building his company.

While the two are not yet officially married, they live together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3dd799e2b1cd9ac2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best black actors and actresses under 40 you should look out for in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Brett Raymer’s income is unknown. However, his company makes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$8-10 million every year</a>. As the company’s co-founder, he receives a substantial share of the income. Also, the entrepreneur bought a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$1.15 million</a>.</p><h3>2. Wayde King</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cd08b9fc621cda70.jpg><p class=align-left>Wayde King is a TV star and a co-founder of ATM Aquariums. On <i>Tanked</i>, Wayde appears in 96 episodes and all the eight specials. His role revolves around negotiating deals with clients and, more importantly, overseeing the company’s daily operations.</p><p class=align-left>When the question of “who started ATM Aquariums” pops up, there are often mixed reactions, considering the relationship between Wayde and Raymer’s family. However, both Brett and Wayde agree that they co-started the company.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Street Outlaws cast salary per episode and member's net worth</p><p class=align-left>What happened to Wayde from <i>Tanked</i>?

Irwin Raymer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3dd799e2b1cd9ac2.jpg><p class=align-left>Irwin Raymer is the oldest cast member in the <i>Tanked</i>. Commonly known as “the fixer,” Irwin helps the ATM employees in solving complex problems, both in business and relational. For example, working with his children creates a perfect environment for him as a father when sibling rivalry between Brett and Heather arises.</p><p class=align-left>Before working at ATM, Irwin was involved in selling machinery. While ATM deals with creating customised aquariums, machinery knowledge is critical, especially when estimating construction costs. Therefore, Irwin is a crucial figure in the general management of ATM.</p><p class=align-left>When Wayde King relocated to Las Vegas, Irwin was the first to interact with him. Their mutual love for fish and aquariums made him introduce Wayde to his daughter Heather and later Brett.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/441583d73f83253a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katerina singer on the spot for branding Rwandese singers Meddy, The Ben lazy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Irwin’s financial information is unknown. However, he has three income streams. He still works at ATM, even after his son-in-law’s divorce with his daughter. Second, the <i>Tanked</i> introduced him to the world of acting.

She was in charge of books on <i>Tanked</i>, and all transactions by the company must get a nod from her. In some instances, Wayde and Brett delegate her to negotiate on behalf of the company in deals.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from her passion for bookkeeping, she loves fish and building customised aquariums. Her love for fish makes her role interesting, especially when creating challenging aquariums in terms of designs.</p><p class=align-left>In addition to balancing her roles, she interacts with her family and Wayde. The interactions — that revolve around family and Wayde — create unscripted conflicts and sometimes passionate and love moments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/21494b0daf46a378.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Presidential dogs: Joe Biden's dogs evicted from White House after biting incident with security personnel</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>The cast of Game Shakers: Where are they now?</p><p class=align-left>Are Wayde and Heather still together? No. In 2019, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ reported</a> that Heather has filed for divorce. Also, Heather’s Instagram bio indicates that she is no longer married to Wayde King. However, her decision to retain her ex-husband’s name was unprecedented, especially considering why they broke up.</p><p class=align-left>While she has worked at Acrylic Tank Manufacturing as an accountant for close to two decades, her real worth is unknown. However, Heather has multiple revenue streams, apart from being a TV star and an accountant.</p><h3>5.

Apart from her dedication to the show, Agnes is famous because of her holiday pictures.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Meet the Swamp People cast and get to know them better</p><p class=align-left>While some sources such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Affair Post</a> have speculated her net worth to be $8 million, Agnes from <i>Tanked</i> is protective of her financial details. However, appearing in more than 70 episodes has given her exposure for more revenue streams.</p><h3>6.
