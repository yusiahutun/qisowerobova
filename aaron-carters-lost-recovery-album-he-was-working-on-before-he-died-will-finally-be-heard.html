The <a href=#>music</a> star, known for his hit song I Want Candy, was a teenager heartthrob at the peak of his time in the spotlight. He tragically died after drowning in his bathtub after the effects of drowsiness from inhaling compressed gas, a coroner’s report said. Now, his twin sister is going to release Aaron Carter’s music he had been working on for the past 10 years in a new record Recovery.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aaron-carter-s-recovery-album-will-be-released-almost-two-years-after-his-death>Aaron Carter’s Recovery album will be released almost two years after his death</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1370262420-1024x703.jpg><p>The 34-year-old had been working on his tracks at the time of his death, but sister Angel Carter Conrad wants fans to hear what he had been working on.</p><p>The 36-year-old sibling told CBS this week, Aaron’s album Recovery will feature a collection of Carter’s unheard songs. Releasing in May, it’ll be 18 months after he died suddenly.</p><p>“The fans have been asking for this music,” Carter said.</p><p>“After Aaron passed away, we put together a benefit concert to honor him called&nbsp;‘The Songs for Tomorrow’ concert, and we had played&nbsp;Recovery&nbsp;during this show. The fans were just reaching out to&nbsp;Aaron Pearce&nbsp;[the album’s producer] and I, begging us to release this music.”</p><p>The title track will arrive on streaming services, like Spotify, tomorrow, (Friday, April 26).</p><p>“Hit me like a hurricane / Caught up in your tidal wave / And now I’m back on solid ground / Tomorrow is a new day / Trying to shake the pain away / Cause I’m still in recovery,” Carter sings in the uplifting song.</p><p>Some of the proceeds from Recovery will go to a good cause, while others will go into a trust for Aaron Carter’s son, Prince. The toddler is two years old, and he shared Prince with Melanie Martin. The Kids Mental Health Foundation – previously known as On Our Sleeves – will benefit from sales.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-losing-siblings-within-months-of-each-other>Losing siblings within months of each other</h2><p>Carter also opened up how she lost another sibling, Bobbie Jean, in 2023, months after Aaron died. Bobbie, who was 41 years old, passed away from a combination of fentanyl and methamphetamine.</p><p>But she also suffered a triple tragedy before that, with the family losing Leslie Carter, another sister of Aaron’s, in 2012 – 10 years before the singer died. Leslie died from an apparent overdose at just 25 years old.</p><p>Carter hopes the family’s grief will help others.</p><p>“The good in this situation is that Aaron does have this platform, and my family has this platform,” she said.</p><p>“I would like to turn this ship around, really start helping some other people, and learn from our story.”</p><p>Aaron Carter’s family announced Recovery was set to release earlier this month, on April 5.</p><p>“I understand why the album didn’t see the light of day for almost 10 years,” producer Pearce wrote on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;at the time.</p><p>“There is a bigger purpose for it now. Aaron would be so grateful that his story lived beyond the tragedy bringing awareness and hope to future generations. We do better when we know better.”</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story, you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688 or Talk To Frank on 0300 123 6600 in the UK</strong>.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eCcK3Aq6anZZOWv7Wx0axkpaejqXqzscKorZ6qqWKura7UpmShnV2srrR51qippKGenHqwuoybnJ%2Bnopp6qbGMnaCenF2stq24jJ%2Bgp5mcocZursRmn56Zopl8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faaron-carters-lost-recovery-album-he-was-working-on-before-he-died-will-finally-be-heard.html&text=Aaron%20Carter%27s%20%27lost%27%20Recovery%20album%20he%20was%20working%20on%20before%20he%20died%20will%20finally%20be%20heard&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faaron-carters-lost-recovery-album-he-was-working-on-before-he-died-will-finally-be-heard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faaron-carters-lost-recovery-album-he-was-working-on-before-he-died-will-finally-be-heard.html&title=Aaron%20Carter%27s%20%27lost%27%20Recovery%20album%20he%20was%20working%20on%20before%20he%20died%20will%20finally%20be%20heard" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faaron-carters-lost-recovery-album-he-was-working-on-before-he-died-will-finally-be-heard.html&title=Aaron%20Carter%27s%20%27lost%27%20Recovery%20album%20he%20was%20working%20on%20before%20he%20died%20will%20finally%20be%20heard" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faaron-carters-lost-recovery-album-he-was-working-on-before-he-died-will-finally-be-heard.html&title=Aaron%20Carter%27s%20%27lost%27%20Recovery%20album%20he%20was%20working%20on%20before%20he%20died%20will%20finally%20be%20heard" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faaron-carters-lost-recovery-album-he-was-working-on-before-he-died-will-finally-be-heard.html&description=Aaron%20Carter%27s%20%27lost%27%20Recovery%20album%20he%20was%20working%20on%20before%20he%20died%20will%20finally%20be%20heard" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jan-frycz-and-magorzata-frycz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jan Frycz and Magorzata Frycz">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tory-lanezs-brother-speaks-rapper-gets-10-year-prison-sentence-megan-thee-stallion-shooting-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tory Lanez's brother speaks out after rapper gets 10 year prison sentence for Megan Thee Stallion sh">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
