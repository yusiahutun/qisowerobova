But who is <a href=# rel=noopener>Mariska Hargitay’s mother</a>, Jayne Mansfield, and what iconic movies has she been in? Read on to find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Mickey-Hargitay.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-mariska-hargitay-s-mother-jayne-mansfield>Who is Mariska Hargitay’s mother, Jayne Mansfield?</h2><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_mariska-hargitay data-tag=mariska-hargitay>Mariska Hargitay</a>‘s mother is actress and Playboy Playmate Jayne Mansfield. Jayne, whose full name is Vera Jayne Palmer, was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, on April 1933. An only child, Jayne wanted to be a Hollywood sdtar like Shirley Temple. When she was 12 years old, she took ballroom dance lessons, and while in high school, she took violin, piano and viola lessons. In 1950, when she was 17 years old, Jayne married Paul Mansfield. The couple had a daughter, Jayne Marie Mansfield, six months later. In 1951, after some time at the Southern Methodist University studying theatre, Jayne moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as an actress. Her time in Hollywood was short-lived, however, as Jayne and Paul moved to Austin, Texas, where she worked as a nude art model, while studying acting at the University of Texas, Austin.</p><p>While in Texas, Jayne was a student of actor Baruch Lumet, the father of director Sidney Lumet, who gave Jayne private acting lessons and helped her get her first screen test at Paramount in 1954. After that, Jayne and Paul moved back to Los Angeles, where she worked different side jobs while modeling part-time for the Blue Book Model Agency. In February 1955, Jayne was named Playboy’s Playmate of the Month. Her appearance in the magazine helped boost her career, and Jayne went on to pose for Playboy several more times from 1955 to 1960. Playboy wasn’t without controversy, however. In 1956, Paul sought custody of his and Jayne’s daughter, alleging that Jayne was an unfit mother because she appeared nude in Playboy.</p><p>Around the time of her Playboy spreads, Jayne’s acting career also took off with movies like Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? The Girl Can’t Help It, The Wayward Buss and Too Hot to Handle. She also became the first major American actress in a post-silent Hollywood film to have a nude scene in Promises! Promises!. Another&nbsp;of her career highlights was when she originated the role of Rita Marlowe in the 1955 Broadway production of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, which won her a Theatre World Award and a Golden Globe.&nbsp; She separated from Paul in 1955 and went on to marry Mariska’s father, Mickey Hargitay, in 1958. The couple had three children before their divorce in 1964. After their divorce, Jayne went on to marry Matt Climber in 1964. The two had a son and divorced in 1966.</p><p>On June 29, 1967, Jayne died in a car accident in Eastern New Orleans at the age of 34. Jayne was killed in a car crash along with her boyfriend, Sam Brody, and their driver, Ronald B. Harrison. Mariska and her brothers, Zoltan and Mickey Jr., were also in the car at the time, but survived. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2018, Mariska opened up about the loss her mom at an early age. “The way I’ve lived with loss is to lean into it,” Mariska said. “As the saying goes, the only way out is through. In my life, certainly I’ve tried to avoid pain, loss, feeling things. But I’ve learned instead to real­ly lean into it, because sooner or later you have to pay the piper. I’m not saying it’s easy, and it certainly hasn’t been for me. There’s been a lot of darkness. But on the other side things can be so bright.”</p><p>Law & Order is available to stream on <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Peacock.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/True-Stories-of-Law-Order.jpg><p>For more about Law & Order, check out <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">True Stories of Law & Order: The Real Crimes Behind the Best Episodes of the Hit TV Show</a> by Kevin Dwyer and Juré Fiorillo.
