Each shop offers a great selection of books along with a unique perk, like supporting other local bookstores or donating a book with every purchase. Some are all-purpose bookstores with huge inventories of new books, while others focus on rare collections or offer a variety of steeply discounted used titles.</p><p>No matter which bookstore ultimately captures your heart, hopefully you can find a huge stack of books to keep you company as you curl up with a blanket and a <a href=#>cup of tea</a>. And should you end up with more books than you could read in a lifetime (hey, it happens to the best of us), you could always <a href=#>learn to speed read</a>, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bookshop-supports-local-bookstores>Bookshop: Supports Local Bookstores</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/b81740bc.png> <a href=#>Bookshop</a><p>Though it's only a year old, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Bookshop</a> has made a huge splash in the book community as it's on a <a href=#>mission to financially support local</a>, independent bookstores. The online bookstore is offering a convenient way to easily and quickly buy books online while simultaneously supporting smaller bookstores. In fact, it gives away more than 75% of its profit margin to bookstores, authors, and publications as a way to help keep the book culture and independent bookselling ecosystem alive and thriving.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bookshop also has an <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">affiliate program</a>, which pays out a 10% commission for every sale and gives a matching 10% to indie bookstores. You can also look up local bookstores in your area on the site's <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">map tool</a>, and Bookshop will ensure they receive the full profit from your order. Otherwise, if you don't look up a local bookstore, earnings from your order will contribute to an earnings pool that's divvied up evenly among independent bookstores, regardless of whether or not they use Bookshop. So far, Bookshop has raised over $10 million for local bookstores.</p><p>The online bookstore has an incredibly large selection of books across all of the standard genres, including categories for other languages and even graphic novels. You can browse Bookshop's weekly bestsellers list, and other ever-rotating categories like "Making Sense of These Times," "Books Turned TV Series," "Afrofuturism," and "The 1970 Book Club."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Purchasing books on the site is easy, as pricing, formats, descriptions, and other details are clearly displayed for each one. It's also easy to contact customer service, initiate a return, or buy a gift card. Bookshop has fairly fast shipping, which is nice to have when you find a book you've just <i>got</i> to read right now. Its only downside, however, is its lack of shipping options for those outside the United States, though it hopes to be able to provide them in the future.</p><h5 class=display-card-title>Bookshop</h5><span>Supports Local Bookstores</span><p class=display-card-description>Enjoy a large selection of books while supporting local bookstores at the same time.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Shop Now</a><h2 id=thriftbooks-inexpensive-new-and-used-books>ThriftBooks: Inexpensive New and Used Books</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/05a657ad.png> <a href=#>ThriftBooks</a><p>If you're on a budget, <a href=#>ThriftBooks</a> is your new best friend.

The store has partnered with libraries and other vendors to ensure books end up in a good home, and not in the trash.</p><p>Based in Washington, ThriftBooks began in 2003 and has since expanded to a 62,000-foot warehouse capable of holding one million books as well as multiple regional processing centers across the United States. It's one of the largest online independent used booksellers, but it also sells CDs, vinyl, video games, DVDs, and Blu-rays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Searching for books on the ThriftBooks is a cinch. You can browse both standard and collectible titles by selecting a specific genre, or you can browse curated choices on the home page, like "Staff Picks," "New and Trending," and "Under $5." Its Collectible Books selection is no less impressive, with first editions, signed copies, and collectible printings. All book conditions are individually rated by a staff member, ranging from New down to Acceptable.</p><p>Format, pricing, condition, and other details are listed on each book's individual page, along with similar title recommendations, related subject suggestions, and customer reviews. For shipping, ThriftBooks charges $0.99 per book for orders under $10, but no additional charge for orders over $10.

Well, that, and it has over a million books on its shelves just waiting to be plucked by an adoring reader like you.</p><p>Powell's is a great place for finding both new books and well-loved (a.k.a. used) titles, but its huge selection makes it a wondrous choice for when you want to do a deep dive on a subject. In fact, it's got "subject" covered, with picks for everything from artist biographies and parapsychology to LGBTQ anthologies and almanacs. There's also a solid variety of audiobooks, signed books, and stuff like notebooks and calendars. Powell's even has <a href=#>book club subscriptions</a>, if that's more your style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you've got a stack of books you've already read and are looking to get rid of, you can <a href=#>sell your books</a> to Powell's. You can get immediate offers online, receive payment via PayPal or in-store credit, and Powell's will even cover the shipping. But be warned, Powell's is particular about what book conditions it accepts (like no Book Club Editions), and you'll need to submit either a minimum of seven books or $9 of in-store credit before the bid will be accepted.</p><p>Powell's also has regular in-store (and now virtual) events, featuring global authors like Roxane Gay, Michio Kaku, and André Aciman with discussions about their books and related topics.

The Strand ships within the United States as well as internationally.</p><h5 class=display-card-title>The Strand</h5><span>Great for Signed Pre-Orders and Rarities</span><p class=display-card-description>Looking to pre-order or rent books?This is the bookstore for you!</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Shop Now</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhtcW1gany4u9GdZKKrXam1pr%2FEZqanpJmjsm6uzqiirKyfp7K0edaio6VlnZa4pnnIrWSemaOuerW7jKucmpxdoryzsYytn6KrXa6yor6O</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fword-is-these-online-bookstores-will-make-it-easy-to-read-more-this-year.html&text=Word%20Is%2c%20These%20Online%20Bookstores%20Will%20Make%20it%20Easy%20to%20Read%20More%20This%20Year&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fword-is-these-online-bookstores-will-make-it-easy-to-read-more-this-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fword-is-these-online-bookstores-will-make-it-easy-to-read-more-this-year.html&title=Word%20Is%2c%20These%20Online%20Bookstores%20Will%20Make%20it%20Easy%20to%20Read%20More%20This%20Year" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fword-is-these-online-bookstores-will-make-it-easy-to-read-more-this-year.html&title=Word%20Is%2c%20These%20Online%20Bookstores%20Will%20Make%20it%20Easy%20to%20Read%20More%20This%20Year" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fword-is-these-online-bookstores-will-make-it-easy-to-read-more-this-year.html&title=Word%20Is%2c%20These%20Online%20Bookstores%20Will%20Make%20it%20Easy%20to%20Read%20More%20This%20Year" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fword-is-these-online-bookstores-will-make-it-easy-to-read-more-this-year.html&description=Word%20Is%2c%20These%20Online%20Bookstores%20Will%20Make%20it%20Easy%20to%20Read%20More%20This%20Year" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eclectic-offerings-come-to-village-this-weekend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eclectic offerings come to Village">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-scott-on-counting-cars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Scott on Counting Cars?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
