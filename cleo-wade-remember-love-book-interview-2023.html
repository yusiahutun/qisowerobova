Her Instagram-friendly poems, often handwritten in all caps, have been shared by everyone from actors like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a44450841/reese-witherspoon-interview-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Reese Witherspoon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Reese Witherspoon</a> to pop stars as big as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a45558484/britney-spears-memoir-the-woman-in-me-excerpt/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Britney Spears" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Britney Spears</a>. Her ability to connect through her words is what made her first book, 2018’s Heart Talk: Poetic Wisdom for a Better Life, a bestseller and a trusted voice to fans and strangers alike. Out today, her fourth literary offering, Remember Love, sees Wade open up to her audience in a new way. She’s not the same woman she was in 2018, after all. She has experienced heartbreak on her own terms, started a family, and, as the years have passed, learned how to simultaneously love and let go.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There’s moments in my life where I feel that I’ve had confidence, whether it was in myself or my writing, or my ideas,” Wade tells Harper’s Bazaar. “But when I started to write with a newer, deeper level of honesty and vulnerability, and with personal things about my own life, I realized that there’s even layers and different depths to confidence and bravery. Because of that, this project was really healing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, Wade details the process of putting together Remember Love, the expectations that come with being the “wise” friend, and why she’s always rooting for Louisiana girls.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How did the writing process for Remember Love differ from the preparation process of your very first book, Heart Talk?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This book was completely different in process, but I don’t feel that my readers will open this book and it feel unfamiliar. They’ll feel that it’s that same kind of friend that writes them books and letters and notes is still there, but the process was so different.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is a book that I wrote in basically complete isolation. I’ve never written something without sharing a lot of it along the way, whether that was sharing things online or sharing things with my friends. I really have written in community a lot, and I think because of that, it’s been really cool, because my other books felt really conversational, and it helped keep the lightness that I felt that just makes a good conversation really helpful. But with this book, I really wanted to go into my own deepest reflections of so many things, like heartbreak. I really wanted to spend time with myself going to the deepest parts of heartbreak and really ask myself, How did I get through that? Or: How did my friends get through those moments? Then—especially when I write about whether it’s my postpartum depression or feeling lost or dealing with change, of which I know so many of us have had to go through these things over the past few years especially—I really wanted to almost dive into those moments and then find the trail that led me to a light that I actually ended up finding within. I feel like when you’re lost, you’re looking everywhere in a dark room for a light switch, and then it’s like all of a sudden, you just need to stand really still and go inward, and you are actually the only thing that can kind of create the light in the room.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My first book (Heart Talk) is really about helpful ideas I’ve had on the other side. I really want Remember Love to be something that was full of the helpful thoughts I had in order to get to the other side. It wasn’t just the “aha!” or the light bulb moments or the kind of really peaceful, helpful advice or words or poems, either. I really wanted to describe or share how I moved through the shadows.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>So much of the book, too, is about being self-reflective and introspective and really looking deep inside oneself for questions that need answers. With that being said, what did writing Remember Love ultimately teach you about yourself as you went through this process?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I found a deeper way to love myself by writing this book. I struggle to love myself. I remember writing in Heart Talk something like: Confidence is something we practice. It’s not saying you just wake up and decide you’re confident. It’s like you nourish yourself with positive thoughts to be confident.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I had to be like, Oh my God, am I going to say this to people? Are they going to be okay if I share this? Part of why I dedicated this book to my readers as my friends was because I was like, Gosh, if I feel like I can’t say this to them, I just shouldn’t even write because I need to always be writing for the most honest possible place that I can get to.</p><img alt="academy museum of motion pictures 2nd annual gala, presented by rolex red carpet" title="Academy Museum of Motion Pictures 2nd Annual Gala, Presented by Rolex - Red Carpet" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cleo-wade-attends-the-academy-museum-of-motion-pictures-2nd-news-photo-1697554715.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stefanie Keenan</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>A big portion of the book focuses on heartbreak, which makes reading it in the context of the year 2023 very interesting. So many people have unofficially declared this “the year of the breakup,” the year of the split, divorce, etc. What do you think it says about society at large right now that we’re witnessing so many splits in such a public way?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s often a great act of love and self-worth to leave a relationship. There’s one part of you that feels like, Wow, are we really loving ourselves more deeply and having a deeper sense of self-worth that we are now unwilling to be in relationships that do not affirm that? There’s a page in that section that says a relationship is work, but your partner should never feel like your job.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s an aspect of people who are demanding more equity and parity in relationships. We’re also saying, “The emotional stuff can’t all be mine,” that “this all can’t be mine.” And so I do feel that if I’m looking at it through the veil of an optimistic lens, I’d say that this kind of season of breakups hopefully also feels like a season of claiming self-worth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I always say to my girlfriends, even when someone breaks up with you, you have to allow people to naturally select themselves out of your pool. And I think that we’re also seeing that there’s so many types of relationships that can make us happy, and we don’t need to be solely reliant on a romantic one. Also, it is a really tender time we’re living in. Our social circles aren’t always your healing circles. If your romantic relationship is not also a space in which you can heal, you’re going to have really tough time staying in that relationship while we live through this tender era.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You’ve become such a trusted voice for so many people, who feel that you and your work resonate with them. When you look at your real-life friendships, is there a pressure in being you just because you’re seen as someone who always has the best advice? Do you ever have a pressure in your real relationships to always have the right thing to say for those specific moments?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, as you know, with the friends that become family, they’re the first ones to humble you. They’re like, “Shut up, Heart Talk”—they do not care, ha. It was really funny. One of my best friends, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g44299022/shiona-turini-style/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shiona Turini" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Shiona Turini</a>, is actually coming on my tour with me. And she says, “Okay, you are like Charlotte [from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a44892594/and-just-like-that-season-2-finale-recap-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sex and the City" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sex and the City</a>]—you have a husband and kids. And I’m just <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a44765446/and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-problem/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Carrie Bradshaw" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Carrie Bradshaw</a> out in these streets.” I feel lucky that so many of my friends don’t take too seriously how I’m able to translate my sense of self and ideas onto a page. I think for some of my friends, it was a little disorienting when I first started touring, because they were like, Hold on, are you the same person with everyone that you are with us? Do you have thousands of new friends? What is this? Do you know what I mean?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think it’s actually just because I’m not a performer, so I don’t have a switched on [persona] even though that would be cool. I really only know how to talk in a really intimate way, which is why I love touring. It’s also why I bring my best friends on my tours, because I wouldn’t really know how to be with a group of people talking about this stuff with somebody who was moderating that I didn’t know very well.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The idea of my book touring, too, is so rooted in how to rebuild community in these spaces. The world is lonelier than it’s ever been, more people are struggling with friendships. At some point you have to ask yourself, How can I help with this? Or what can I do about this? I don’t think I can solve this crisis, but I do feel that I’m not going to allow the size of the problem to stop me from trying to chip in however I can, even if it’s just in my little book tour.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Also, I saw Britney Spears shared one of your poems the other day!</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">God, can you believe that? I’m unable to handle that. You don’t understand, I’m from Louisiana, so the Britney Spears fandom—I am true to this. Not new to this. I can’t even tell you.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I love that when you shared in your Instagram story, you said “Louisiana Girls,” and I thought that was so cute and so sweet. You’re very proudly from New Orleans, one of my favorite cities in the world. What makes up being a Louisiana girl? And how does being from there shape your creative outlook, especially as you’ve become someone who goes all over the globe for your job?</strong><br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think when you’re proud of someone from Louisiana, you’re not at the center of a city or any connections to anything. Do you know what I mean? Whether you’re Britney Spears in Louisiana or you’re Reese Witherspoon from Tennessee, you weren’t a kid who just kind of grew up in Los Angeles or New York. You were nowhere near the cities where you eventually made it to become at the top of your field. People have such pride being from these places that have no market for what they do.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With Southern people, really, our culture is so specific. Like, everyone’s proud of Beyoncé being from Texas. She’s not from New York City. When I think about being from Louisiana, I feel that way too. I really grew up from a poor family in Louisiana. The idea that I would be invited to a fashion show is not something I even would allow myself to dream of as a kid, or the fact that I could walk into any bookstore and see my book on a table. I couldn’t believe I wrote a book coming from where I came from, coming from the family I came from, coming from the background I came from. I couldn’t believe it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think if I didn’t grow up in a place that was so unique, I would’ve felt the need to come into the working world as someone who really conformed. And I would’ve never written poetry at a time where there was zero market for poetry and no one wanted Heart Talk. I sold that book door-to-door. The idea that people read it to this day will never stop shocking me, because no publishers wanted it, no bookstores wanted it. It was so hard to even get that book in the hands of my readers.<strong><br></strong></p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What do you want your readers to ultimately take away from Remember Love?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a world that is trying to hack at everything or give you five ways to get through everything, if none of that is working for you, and no matter how many of the three self-care things somebody told you to do that day, no matter how much of them you did or how often you did it, and you still don’t feel better because you’re just in the midst of grief or you just had your heart broken—know that it’s okay.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Can you remember love? Can you love yourself in that moment? I truly only named this book that because it was my own mantra during a hard time. I was like, God, can I remember love and how I’m treating myself right now if I feel that I’ll never feel better again? I remember the first day that the sun came out after Hurricane Katrina, when I lived in New Orleans. I remember that the storm ended and then the sun shined on everything. Now, I can really gift myself that knowingness of resilience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0"><i>Remember Love: Words for Tender Times</i>, by Cleo Wade</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$16 at Amazon for iRemember Love: Words for Tender Times/i, by Cleo Wade" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593581369 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593581369 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593581369 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$16 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593581369 data-vars-ga-product-id=6c7edc06-8075-4187-9cbb-9896ddf8046e data-vars-ga-product-price=$15.77 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=534eb665-6884-44ec-9b26-29abf6db8b3f data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | On Sale" data-vars-ga-sku=0593581369 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="iRemember Love: Words for Tender Times/i, by Cleo Wade" title="iRemember Love: Words for Tender Times/i, by Cleo Wade" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1691167201-715r64liZtL.jpg width=1688 height=2550 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0"><i>Remember Love: Words for Tender Times</i>, by Cleo Wade</h2></p><p>Now 39% Off</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
