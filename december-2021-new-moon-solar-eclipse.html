But there's a reason eclipses have their own "seasons," and we're still very much in the heart of the last one of the year. And as the first week of December closes out, the final new moon and solar eclipse of the year will occur in mutable fire sign Sagittarius. And although it's a new moon, you could get the sense that a particular chapter of your life is closing, as this will be the final eclipse of the Sagittarius-Gemini series that started back on June 5, 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This intense, ground-shifting moment, which will be exact at 2:42 a.m. ET on December 4th (or 11:42 p.m. PT on December 3rd), is a wake-up call to be honest, open, and ready for curveballs that will inevitably show up now.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The new moon in Sagittarius nudges you to reach a fiery conclusion.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">New moons — which happen when the confident sun pairs up with the security-seeking moon — generally offer the chance to gain clarity around a new chapter you want to write over the course of the next two weeks (up until the next full moon) and next six months (when the corresponding full moon occurs).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And when a new moon is accompanied by a solar eclipse — which happens when the moon casts a shadow on the sun — the intensity of the moment is amplified, underlining your motivation to recognize your truest emotions, stand in your sense of self, and take the initiative to move boldly down a whole new path.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That adventurous, pioneering spirit is magnified by the fact that this particular new moon and solar eclipse is happening in free-spirited, bold, outspoken Sagittarius — ruled by go-big-or-go-home Jupiter. This also means you can expect changes occurring around this new moon to revolve around truth- and knowledge-seeking, long-distance travel, belief systems, and faith.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>A conjunction to Mercury highlights communication.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the main aspects of this Sag new moon and solar eclipse is a conjunction to messenger Mercury, the planet of communication and technology, which colors how we think and express ourselves. And when it is in Sagittarius, we're more likely to speak in an unfiltered, entertaining, opinionated, and philosophical way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jupiter tends to cast a "bigger is better" tone on everything it comes in touch with, so the flavor of the way you speak about your eclipse-driven dreams, epiphanies, and course changes will be far from subtle now.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Uranus spikes nervous tension and even more out-of-the-blue change.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The new moon will also form a quincunx — one of the most awkward angles that can exist between two planets — to Uranus, the planet of sudden change and rebellion, currently moving through fixed earth sign Taurus. This can result in a crackling, electric nervous energy that can have you feeling antsy, anxious, and just generally unsettled. It might also manifest in an incident in which you're pushed to make challenging changes to your everyday life or to switch up your approach to your big-picture goals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although we usually think of full moons as the lunar event most tied to losing sleep — thanks in part to the big, luminous celestial body's light at its most radiant — this darker aspect could produce a similar effect, as a result of Uranus. So if you're finding yourself wide awake at 2 a.m., consider that an opportunity to get clear on the changes you would ideally make versus those you feel you're being forced into, and reflect on how you might most productively bridge the gap.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Saturn offers a grounding vibe.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although we tend to think of Saturn as the Debbie Downer of all the planets, given that it oversees restriction, limitation, and boundaries, it can also bring structure, diligence, and stabilization. Because the new moon forms a sextile to the taskmaster planet, currently moving through Aquarius, you could find yourself centered by a pragmatic game plan. By putting your nose to the grindstone now, ideally in a forward-thinking way, you can even better cope with the changes you're currently — and soon to be — experiencing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It also bears noting that the energy and themes around this eclipse echo those around the Saturn-Uranus square we've been experiencing all year. The push-pull between the status quo and revolution, foundational structures, and electrifying shake-ups, is coming even more into focus as we approach the third and final square of the year on December 24. Whether you're crossing your fingers that you can take what you know to the next level or move forward in a radical new way, this square should present various challenging — but also potentially eye-opening — moments over the next few weeks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, how this Sagittarius new moon and solar eclipse will affect you, based on your sign.
