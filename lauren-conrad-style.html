(The latter might surprise you the most!)</p><p><b>StyleCaster: Every woman has stuff her closet she no longer loves. What are some great tips for revitalizing your closet?</b><br><strong>Lauren Conrad: </strong>I think that everyone’s gone through this, where you just basically get into a style rut and you’re just kind of over everything in your closet. I recently moved [in with my boyfriend William Tell], so I had to move everything in my closet, and it was kind of like Christmas Day. I took a day to get rid of stuff and purge, and I just found pieces that had been sitting in my closet forever, things I got like 7 years ago. I was able to interject a little newness and bring back old pieces.</p><p><strong>So what’s the number one thing women can do to make it an easier project to work on?</strong><br>I went through my entire wardrobe, and anything I hadn’t worn in a year I set aside. Then I went through that pile. There are some things that are special occasion pieces, but anything that you’re ready to step away from, just donate it. The stuff that I was still a little iffy about, I put into suitcases and just stored them. If I don’t go into my suitcases over the next six months, I get rid of it.</p><p>I have a weird connection with my clothes, so it’s hard! I was a little bit upset when I had to get rid of some things. But you just have to go through and decide what youre wearing, what you’re not, and what you’re missing.</p><p><b><a href=#>You just moved in with your boyfriend</a>, congrats! How have you had to adjust your life to living with a guy?</b><br>The place I moved into, we renovated the place—we’ve been working on it for over a year now. I kind of redid it all really. It was nice to start from scratch. I bought a place and basically gutted it, and my father’s an architect so we designed it together. It was really fun, but it was a little overwhelming to have so many choices.</p><p><b>We know how much you love Halloween. What are you going to be this year?</b><br>I’d love to know! I’m just like calling around. I’m going to be in Vegas celebrating my little brothers 21st birthday. I don’t want to embarrass him by going in full costume. I was thinking about wearing a little cocktail dress and then making big lace bunny ears and maybe a little bunny tail, and then I can quickly take them off if it’s not a costume party.</p><p><strong>What have some of your favorite costumes in the past been?</strong><br>Last year I did Mary Poppins, and I just ordered a little red bowtie. My girlfriend owns the umbrella with the parrot head. And I owned the hat. Once I was a ghoul, like a ghost, I just went and bought yards and yards of tulle. I made a dress out of it. I’m trying to figure out a different way to wear it this year because I liked it so much. Two years before I made a bluebird costume out of ostrich feather boas sewing them onto a little bodysuit. I basically just make costumes for children [then wear them].<b><br></b></p><p><b>Any of <a title="Fall Fashion: 12 Trends to Know&nbsp;Now" href=#>Fall’s trends</a> that you’re particularly in love with right now?</b><br>This fall, I’m really loving all the lighter grays and whites. Things look really dark during the fall, and I love those lighter tones. As far as knits, I’m jumping for turtlenecks right now. I love sweaters so much.</p><p><b>Who are your style icons?</b><br>I’m terrible at this question, because I really don’t have any. I really just make it up as I go along.</p><p><b>What’s your favorite look you’ve worn out and about lately?</b><br>I wore a little leather pencil skirt the other day but with a cropped sweater, I think that’s a fun way to do in-between months because you’re cozy and still put-together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2idnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pfHN8lmlpaWeclsKzsc1mmqimopaxbr%2FTsqOeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flauren-conrad-style.html&text=Lauren%20Conrad%20Talks%20Style%20and%20Moving%20in%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flauren-conrad-style.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flauren-conrad-style.html&title=Lauren%20Conrad%20Talks%20Style%20and%20Moving%20in%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flauren-conrad-style.html&title=Lauren%20Conrad%20Talks%20Style%20and%20Moving%20in%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flauren-conrad-style.html&title=Lauren%20Conrad%20Talks%20Style%20and%20Moving%20in%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flauren-conrad-style.html&description=Lauren%20Conrad%20Talks%20Style%20and%20Moving%20in%20With%20Her%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./peach-and-pecan-sandy-crumble.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="peach and pecan sandycrumble">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./419967-chris-henchy-net-worth-height-wife-wedding-daughters-movies-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Henchy: Net worth, height, wife, wedding, daughters, movies">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
