Desi weddings are the perfect opportunity to bring out your traditional bests and go all out with your outfits. However, when it comes to deciding what to pick, it may sometimes seem like a challenge with so many aspects to confuse you. So we've decided to take some inspiration from our Bollywood divas and put together the ultimate wedding lookbook for you. From Deepika Padukone to Katrina Kaif, refer to this guide so that you never miss the memo and can ace wedding guest style with the grace and shine you need!</p><p><strong>1. Janhvi Kapoor's angelic white number</strong></p><p><img alt="Janhvi Kapoor (Credits: Instagram @janhvikapoor)" title="Janhvi Kapoor (Credits: Instagram @janhvikapoor)" width=1170 height=1432 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-02/1676367633_87ef8553-8aff-4023-8ebb-91deacd59e0f.jpeg></p><p>In today's time, when less is more, more and more wedding guests are opting for effortless and graceful numbers that look easygoing and yet make a statement. Janhvi Kapoor's white sari from her Mili promotions is definitely a look to bookmark. The strapless, embroidered blouse, graceful drape, and the perfect ivory color is the right mix for any wedding ceremony. You can let your hair down in beach waves, or always switch things up with a classy bun or slicked-back hairstyle. Don't forget to accessorize with little pops of color and take your outfit to the next level!</p><p><strong>2. Katrina Kaif's classic red sari</strong></p><p><img alt="Katrina Kaif (Credits: Instagram @katrinakaif)" title="Katrina Kaif (Credits: Instagram @katrinakaif)" width=1170 height=1447 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-02/1676367753_b07ba313-649c-4a3a-aa3d-5b811228cd40.jpeg></p><p>No one does ethnic like <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","25 Bollywood-approved wedding guest outfits to ensure you&#39;re the best dressed","1209238","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-will-katrina-kaifs-zoya-and-deepika-padukones-rubai-have-a-crossover-pathaan-writer-reacts-1207866","articlepage","/fashion/CelebFashion/25-bollywood-approved-wedding-guest-outfits-to-ensure-youre-the-best-dressed-1209238","Katrina Kaif,","Body_Hyperlink","fashion","CelebFashion")'>Katrina Kaif,</a> and time and time again she has delivered some stunning looks when it comes to wedding events.
