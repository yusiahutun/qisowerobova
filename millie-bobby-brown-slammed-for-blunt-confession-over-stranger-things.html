The TV star admitted she’s waiting for it to end and is ready to say,” goodbye.”</strong></p><p>The 19-year-old said that <a href=#>Stranger Things</a>, which premiered seven years ago, has limited her ability to pursue other projects and “create stories that she’s passionate about.” However, the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s brutal comments about how she’s feeling has upset some hardcore fans of the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-saying-goodbye-to-stranger-things-let-s-get-out-of-here>Saying goodbye to Stranger Things – ‘Let’s get out of here’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1437149717-683x1024.jpg><p>Millie <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Glamour: “When you’re ready, you’re like, ‘All right, let’s do this. Let’s tackle this last senior year. Let’s get out of here.</p><p>“Stranger Things takes up a lot of time to film, and it’s preventing me from creating stories that I’m passionate about. So I’m ready to say, ‘Thank you, and goodbye.'”</p><p>However, Millie, who plays the role of Eleven, a girl with supernatural powers in the fan-favorite series, had nothing but praise for the show. She said that it had given her “the tools and the resources to be a better actor.’</p><p>There is also room for potential cast reunions, as she said: “When it ends, I’m going to be able to still see these people.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-some-fans-say-millie-should-be-grateful-for-her-netflix-fame>Some fans say Millie should be ‘grateful’ for her Netflix fame</h2><p>However, some fans weren’t happy with her candid confession.</p><p>One user wrote on <a href=#>Twitter</a> that “she owns them her name”, referring to her big break coming from the Netflix hit.</p><p>But others came to her defense, as someone added: “Y’all in the comments act like you’ve never had a job that drained you of your time and energy.”</p><p>A second added: “It’s time. Incredible chapter in all these actors’ lives, tho! Made a lot of ’em household names.”</p><p>Then a third said: “As sad as I will be, at the same happy she’s advancing in her career.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-met-her-best-friend-noah-schnapp-on-set>She met her best friend Noah Schnapp on set</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1397269423-1-1024x683.jpg><p>The actress has developed many meaningful friendships with her co-stars over the years, with one in particular being the Will Byers actor. The pair have shared numerous moments together, whether in the spotlight or behind the scenes.</p><p>Noah also opened up about coming out as gay to Millie, and he didn’t do it in a way that you would expect.</p><p>He told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Variety</a>: “I just FaceTimed her one day in the middle of a Party City and I was like, ‘Millie, I’m gay.’ And she was like, ‘Oh, Schnapper! You told me finally!’”</p><p>He said that after coming out to his family, he made a list of those who he would tell before announcing it publically, with Millie being on the list. He tried telling her in person numerous times but said that he backed out as he had been too nervous.</p><p>Talking about Noah, Millie said that her fiancé, Jake, who’s the son of <a href=#>rock star</a> Jon Bon Jovi, thought she was in love with her 19-year-old co-star.</p><p>During an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show, she explained: “Jake, who is my boyfriend, when we first met he was like, <strong>‘</strong>You guys are in love,'”. However, she cleared things up fast, telling him: “It’s in the most Platonic way.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-at-only-19-millie-has-had-a-really-successful-career>At only 19, Millie has had a really successful career</h2><p>Millie has starred in other <a href=#>Netflix</a> projects, including the Sherlock Holmes adaptation Enola Holmes and its sequel, and the upcoming movie Damsel, in which she has the lead role, and it was produced by her production company, PCMA.</p><p>She is also UNICEF’s youngest ever Goodwill ambassador and said she was “honored” to have the title.</p><p>“It’s a huge honor to join such an impressive list of people who have supported UNICEF over the years,” she said at the time.</p><p>“I am looking forward to meeting as many children and young people as I can, hearing their stories, and speaking out on their behalf.”</p><p>She even has her own makeup and skincare brand, Florence By Mills. Alongside the beauty industry, she has also just published her first novel, Nineteen Steps, which she wrote after being inspired by her grandmother’s Second World War stories.</p><p>“Inspired by my Nanny Ruth, this book is very personal and close to my heart,” she said in a statement, “I grew up listening to stories about her time living through the war. I’m honored to keep her story alive.”</p><p>The final season of Stranger Things is definitely not the last we’ve seen of Millie.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aEcLnIpaOinV2XvKOu2GaZq6eno3q0uMCmpJ6cXZu8s3nBpaynrF2YvK%2ByxKyqoqeeYry3sdFmqq2qkaO0pr6MrZ%2BippeofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmillie-bobby-brown-slammed-for-blunt-confession-over-stranger-things.html&text=Millie%20Bobby%20Brown%20slammed%20for%20blunt%20confession%20over%20Stranger%20Things&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmillie-bobby-brown-slammed-for-blunt-confession-over-stranger-things.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmillie-bobby-brown-slammed-for-blunt-confession-over-stranger-things.html&title=Millie%20Bobby%20Brown%20slammed%20for%20blunt%20confession%20over%20Stranger%20Things" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmillie-bobby-brown-slammed-for-blunt-confession-over-stranger-things.html&title=Millie%20Bobby%20Brown%20slammed%20for%20blunt%20confession%20over%20Stranger%20Things" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmillie-bobby-brown-slammed-for-blunt-confession-over-stranger-things.html&title=Millie%20Bobby%20Brown%20slammed%20for%20blunt%20confession%20over%20Stranger%20Things" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmillie-bobby-brown-slammed-for-blunt-confession-over-stranger-things.html&description=Millie%20Bobby%20Brown%20slammed%20for%20blunt%20confession%20over%20Stranger%20Things" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./new-details-shed-light-sinister-minister-killed-second-wife-waits-stand-trial-wifes-mysterious-death-falling-stairs-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New details on how 'Sinister Minister' A.B.
