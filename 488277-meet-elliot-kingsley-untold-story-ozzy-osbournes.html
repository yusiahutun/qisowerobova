He is the son of Thelma Riley (mother) and Ozzy Osbourne (father). Furthermore, he has two stepsiblings, Jessica Starshine Osbourne and<a href=#> Louis Osbourne</a>.</p><p class=align-left>He grew up in Birmingham, England, where he experienced his childhood and went to school. However, Elliot Kingsley is not Ozzy Osbourne's son. His mother married Ozzy Osbourne when he was five years old.</p><p class=align-left>Thelma Riley and Ozzy Osbourne met in 1971 at the Rum Runner nightclub in Birmingham. At that time, Elliot’s mother worked as a waitress at the club. However, Thelma Riley later became an educator, working as an English teacher in a <a href=#>local school </a>in Leicestershire, England.</p><p class=align-left>Thelma and Ozzy wed a few months later. As a result, Ozzy Osbourne adopted Elliot and made him his stepchild. Unfortunately, the identity of Elliot Kingsley's biological father has never been known. In 1972 and 1975, Thelma and Ozzy welcomed Jessica and Louis Osbourne, respectively. Elliot became their stepsibling.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dc69ae22c73397ec.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ronnie O'Neal's story: crimes committed, trial, and sentence</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The marriage between Elliot’s mother and Ozzy Osbourne never worked. Thelma asked for a divorce, which the two finalised in 1982, ending their eleven years of marriage. Ozzy termed his first marriage a terrible mistake and<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> later admitted</a> that he was a bad stepfather to Elliot and that his drug and alcohol use, combined with frequent absences while touring with his band, cost him his marriage.</p><p class=align-left>Even before divorcing Elliot’s mother, Ozzy hooked up with Sharon and fell in love with her. At the same time, his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">marriage to Thelma</a> was intact. Eventually, Ozzy married Sharon Osbourne and welcomed three children, Aimee, Kelly, and Jack Osbourne.</p><h2>Professional career</h2><p class=align-left>Elliot Kingsley has worked as a theatrical actor for most of his life. He appeared in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, portraying Julius. He also played the role of Liam in <i>The Story Giant</i>.

The only person who got a mention in the <a href=# title>TV series</a> was Elliot’s elder sister Jessica Starshine Osbourne.
