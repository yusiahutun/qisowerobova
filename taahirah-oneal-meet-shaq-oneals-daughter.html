Shaquille, popular as Shaq, is an American former professional basketball player. He is also a sports analyst on the television program “Inside the NBA.” Famous as a four-time NBA champion, Shaquille is considered one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.</p><p>Despite being the daughter of a successful basketball player, Taahirah has set out to find her success while honoring her roots and background. Although many fans thought she would play basketball like her father, she didn’t. She chose a career away from the spotlight and shows the world her unique talent.</p><p>Here’s a glimpse into the life of the oldest O’Neal child.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-21_10-49-36-fotor-2023062110536.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Taahirah_ONeal_Shaqs_Oldest_Daughter></span>Who Is Taahirah O’Neal, Shaq’s Oldest Daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shaq welcomed Taahirah into the world with his former girlfriend, Arnetta Yardbourgh, on July 19, 1996. Her birth made the basketball legend a first-time dad. It must have been a proud moment for Shaquille, who had only concluded a $121 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers 24 hours before her birth.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Shaq’s mini-me shies away from the spotlight. Hence, there are no details regarding her elementary and high school education. However, according to TNT’s “Shaq Life,” she graduated Magna cum laude from Oglethorpe University in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-21_10-50-03-fotor-20230621105417.jpg><p>Unlike most celebrity kids, Taahirah is charting a course different from her dad’s. According to reports, she is a communications analyst at PepsiCo., a multicultural business and equity development organization. The oldest daughter of Shaq also works as a social media assistant at her dad’s entertainment company, Mine O Mine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Were_Taahirah_ONeals_Parents_Married></span>Were Taahirah O’Neal’s Parents Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No. Shaquille is famous as a mega-celebrity and an NBA star who remains relevant to the basketball world after many years of retirement. Taahirah was born to him and his high school sweetheart, Arnetta Yardbourgh, who later became his lover. Rumors had it the former couple were about to tie the knot but never made it down the aisle.</p><p>Like Taahirah, her mother, Arnetta Yardbourgh, is an educated woman who stays out of the limelight. She is a professional life coach with a master’s degree. With these two in her life, Taahirah feels blessed. She opened up in a podcast about how she would never change her childhood and is grateful for her parents, who gave her a decent upbringing.</p><p>In addition, she also spoke about how it felt to have successful parents. Although most people expect her to be perfect and have an impressive resume like her parents, she revealed how that can be hard. Despite the comparisons and trolling, Taahirah O’Neal has achieved immense success in her chosen career.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Taahirah_ONeal_Siblings></span>Taahirah O’Neal Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Taahirah is the only child her parents had together, she has five other siblings from her father’s former marriage with his ex-wife, Shaunie O’Neal.</p><p>First is Myles O’Neal, born in 1997 to Shaunie. Although Myles is not Shaq’s biological son, he became his stepson after his mom and the retired basketball player tied the knot. Hence, he is Taahirah’s stepbrother. Unlike Taahirah, Myles is no stranger to the entertainment scene.</p><p>He is a musician and model who has graced TV screens. Myles appeared on his mom’s reality TV series, “Basketball Wives,” in&nbsp;2010. Additionally, he made his runway debut in Dolce & Gabbana’s Spring 2018 show during Milan Fashion Week.</p><p>While Taahirah O’Neal has forged her career path, Shareef O’Neal follows in their father’s footsteps. Shareef O’Neal is the first son of the now-separated couple, Shaunie and Shaq. Shareef played college basketball for the University of California, Los Angeles, and Louisiana State University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-21_10-49-57-fotor-20230621105120.jpg><p>Next is Amirah O’Neal, the second daughter of the NBA champion. This apple also didn’t fall far from the tree. Like her older brother, she is also a college athlete who plays basketball for the Texas State University.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Shareef and Amirah, Shaqir O’Neal also has a passion for sports. He plays the forward position for Texas State University. In an interview with Overtime, <a href=#>Shaqir O’Neal</a> announced his commitment to the school team and his plans to make it to the NBA.</p><p>Last but not least is Taahirah O’Neal’s youngest sibling, Me’arah O’Neal. While there is little information about her, several reports claim she had college offers from UCLA, TCU, Virginia, and Howard University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although Shaquille never married Taahirah’s mother, the father-daughter duo have an inseparable bond, and she refers to him as her “partner in crime.” <a href=#>Deja Jackson</a> is another celebrity child who stays away from the spotlight. But like Taahirah, she is close to her father, Ice Cube.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwaKtx6KpmqBdpLumrctmpJ6dpGLAqa3QZqannZGhwG6wwK6eoayVp3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaahirah-oneal-meet-shaq-oneals-daughter.html&text=Taahirah%20O%27Neal%3a%20Meet%20Shaq%20O%27Neal%27s%20Daughter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaahirah-oneal-meet-shaq-oneals-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaahirah-oneal-meet-shaq-oneals-daughter.html&title=Taahirah%20O%27Neal%3a%20Meet%20Shaq%20O%27Neal%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaahirah-oneal-meet-shaq-oneals-daughter.html&title=Taahirah%20O%27Neal%3a%20Meet%20Shaq%20O%27Neal%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaahirah-oneal-meet-shaq-oneals-daughter.html&title=Taahirah%20O%27Neal%3a%20Meet%20Shaq%20O%27Neal%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaahirah-oneal-meet-shaq-oneals-daughter.html&description=Taahirah%20O%27Neal%3a%20Meet%20Shaq%20O%27Neal%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-sound-of-music-cast-then-and-now-julie-andrews-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 'Sound of Music' Cast Then and Now: Julie Andrews and More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./colageno-belleza-que-es-como-se-usa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="qu es y por qu es beneficioso para la piel?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
