If you're looking for an oil to soothe damaged, dry, and brittle hair, coconut oil is a perfect choice. Caution! Be it any hair type, over-applying any hair oil can make your scalp greasy.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> Choosing cold-pressed coconut oil is better for your hair care routine since it is considered to have more nutrients than expeller-pressed. Cold-pressed products are a good choice because these oils do not use heat or chemicals for extraction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Yes, the price tag plays a major role. Though sold at very cheap prices in tropical regions due to its vast harvest, the coconut oils sold across the globe may differ in terms of pricing. At times, the cost may reflect its ingredients and quality, so you can choose the best coconut oil for hair without it being too expensive.</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Nutrients and fatty acids found in coconut oil are great for hair health. Our contributor Kate Ross, says, “Sometimes, other helpful things are added to coconut oil to make your hair even happier. For example, some oils like argan oil have extra vitamins which enrich coconut oil, or tea tree oil, which is good for your scalp.” It is used to treat dandruff, revive dull, damaged hair, reduce frizz, and shield hair from heat. Also, for thicker and longer hair, it aids in clearing sebum buildup.</p><p><strong>Certifications</strong>: Opt for oils that have organic, non-GMO, or fair trade certifications. This way, you rest assured that you're choosing both ethical and sustainable options.</p><p><strong>Fractionated Oil</strong>: If you prefer a coconut oil that has a more lightweight formula, then we suggest that you opt for a fractionated oil. It will get easily absorbed into the hair without leaving behind a greasy feeling.</p><p><strong>RBD Label:</strong> An RBD (Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized) label means that the oil you’re choosing is a refined coconut oil. If you want a more natural option, you should go for virgin or unrefined oils.</p><p><strong>Cold/Expeller-pressed</strong>: Cold-pressed or expeller-pressed oils have the capacity to retain a higher percentage of natural nutrients when compared to oils that are extracted using heat.</p><p><strong>Color</strong>: Coconut oil in its natural form is usually white or off-white. This way you can know if the oil you're choosing is refined or unrefined.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use the Best Coconut Oil for Hair in Daily Routine?</h2></p><p>Here are a few tips to rightly apply coconut oil for hair on an everyday basis -&nbsp;</p><li><strong>Prewash Protector</strong>: Applying coconut oil on the hair roots before washing your hair may help to reduce the amount of water that your hair absorbs, thereby decreasing the likelihood that your hair will get damaged or dry.</li><li><strong>Conditioner</strong>: You can use coconut oil as an alternative to standard conditioners. Or add a few drops of the oil to your usual conditioner to boost its smoothing effect</li><li><strong>Hairstyling Essential</strong>: Just a dab of coconut oil can go a long way when it comes to taming frizzy hair. For easier absorption and styling, make sure to apply the oil to damp hair.</li><p><h2 class=title>Who Should Use Coconut Oil?</h2></p><p>People with the below-mentioned hair types and issues can greatly benefit by using coconut oil. Let's take a look at how:</p><p><strong>Dry And Damaged Hair</strong></p><p>Coconut oil has the power to retain moisture, and this makes it great for hair that's dry and damaged. It improves the elasticity of the strands, thus reducing the amount of hair breakage.</p><p><strong>Oily Hair</strong></p><p>Though it's hard to believe, coconut oil helps the scalp to produce less oil, helping balance out hair that is overly oily. Plus, there are lightweight coconut oils that don't make the hair greasy too.</p><p><strong>Color-treated Hair</strong></p><p>Coconut oil protects color-treated hair by forming a shield over it – this reduces damage and protein loss. It also adds a desirable shine and makes the hair color appear more vibrant.</p><p><strong>Scalp Issues</strong></p><p>Coconut oil has anti-fungal properties which make it very useful in battling dandruff and treating dry scalp or infections. It also soothes dryness and irritation in the scalp.</p><p><strong>Hair Growth And Thickness</strong></p><p>Massaging coconut oil into the scalp improves blood flow which can potentially promote healthy hair growth. The nutrients present in the oil also nourish the hair follicles, making the hair thicker.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Kate Ross, Hair and Beauty Specialist - <a href=#>Irresistible Me</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Treating your hair to some nourishing coconut oil can help reap the best benefits of this miracle fruit.
