Nic got stabbed while she was heavily pregnant, and fans were bracing for bad news for a moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, both made it out alive, which meant no more tears for the viewers.

When season 5 premiered, viewers were ready to watch Nic’s blissful personal life unfold.</p><p>But Nick didn’t appear in the first episode. She was away on a spa retreat to take care of her health. If you haven’t watched the fifth season yet, then you have been warned about major spoilers ahead.</p><p>The medical drama fans’ worst fears were proven right in the second episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Conrad answered the door only to find two police officers to tell him about his wife’s accident.&nbsp;</p><p>The showrunners didn’t try to prolong this plotline by keeping Nic on life support for the next few episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>In a very emotional scene of the third episode, Conrad was told that Nic wasn’t coming back. She was declared brain dead after sustaining traumatic head injuries.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as she died, she helped others by getting her organs donated.</p><p>It was truly a heartbreaking episode for the audience who watched it in hopes that maybe their favorite character would recover from this too.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title='CANVAS TV SHOW POSTER - The Resident (Matt Czuchry, Emily VanCamp) - Silk Giclee Print (11"x17")' href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OnB26dKNL._SL500_.jpg alt='CANVAS TV SHOW POSTER - The Resident (Matt Czuchry, Emily VanCamp) - Silk Giclee Print (11"x17")' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title='The reason behind Nic&#39;s departure from "The Resident" 3'></a></p><p>Since it’s clear that Emily isn’t returning, fans are hoping to see her in some flashback scene in the upcoming seasons.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reason Behind Emily VanCamp’s Emotional Exit</h2><p>Before season 5 aired, Fox had already announced that Emily VanCamp had left the show. Even in the show’s trailer, she only appeared briefly.&nbsp;</p><p>That glimpse gave fans hope of her getting some air time in the season.</p><p>Although Emily’s imminent departure was already known, nobody predicted how her iconic character would end its run.&nbsp;</p><p>When Emily was asked about her shocking exit, she assured that it was for the best.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="Emily VanCamp - 18X24 Rare Poster Print FCA #IDP391378" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Hp+ebnGfS._SL500_.jpg alt="Emily VanCamp - 18X24 Rare Poster Print FCA #IDP391378" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title='The reason behind Nic&#39;s departure from "The Resident" 4'></a></p><p>In May, VanCamp had asked the executive producer to release her from the contract with the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being so attached to the franchise, she felt this was the right time to move on. When Nicolette was pregnant, so was Emily in real life.&nbsp;</p><p>While their timeline wasn’t the same, it helped Emily keep the joyful secret for a bit longer.</p><p>In August 2021, Emily welcomed her first child Iris with Josh Bowman.</p><p>Like many other actresses, she also felt that this was the right time to spend with family.

But in this case, it’s the exact opposite.
