Jeffree Star has opened up a huge can of worms as he reignites the infamous drama in the beauty community by calling out James Charles.</strong></p><p>For anyone who was captivated by the <a href=#>influencer</a> drama that took hold of social media in 2019, it’s apparently back four years later. <a href=#>James Charles and former friend Tati Westbrook</a>, beauty influencers, were embroiled in a huge feud that held the online sphere in a chokehold. The <a href=#>YouTube</a> stars posted videos accusing each other of bad behavior – and a lot more – which results in millions of followers jumping ship. Millionaire Jeffree Star chimed in on the scandal, later apologizing, but he’s retreated once again. The star has a lot to say about the young star Charles, <a href=#>who recently launched their own makeup</a> line.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jeffree-star-takes-aim-at-james-charles-again>Jeffree Star takes aim at James Charles (again)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1482330636-1024x683.jpg><p>The makeup mogul Jefree, whose fame skyrocketed even further with his cosmetics brand, spilled what he really thought on a podcast. The 37-year-old joined <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bunnie XO for the Dumb Blonde podcast</a>, and he did hold back.</p><p>He called out James, 24, over ex messaging allegations – which <a href=#>James has spoken out about himself</a>. The star said he was “mortified” when he found out a fan he was messaging turned out to be 16.</p><p>When speaking about his opinions on the cosmetics world, he slammed one person in particular. He waited until the end to drop the name that it was indeed James Charles.</p><p>But one sentence in his scathing rant clearly has the potential to stir the pot once again.</p><p>Jefree said: “He is the biggest piece of s*** in the beauty industry.”</p><p>Not holding back, he further claimed there were “demonic snakes” at play in the multi-billion dollar beauty realm.</p><p>It comes only a matter of weeks after James launched a comeback. His <a href=#>new makeup line, Painted</a>, released in summer of 2023 as the star tries to go back to his roots.</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit and GRV Media have approached James Charles’ representatives for comment.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-rise-and-fall-of-james-charles>The rise and fall of James Charles</h2><p>James Charles had the biggest beauty channel on YouTube. His fame rose when his 2016 senior yearbook photo went viral on <a href=#>Twitter</a>. Applying a killer highlight for the picture, people loved his look and his adoration of makeup.</p><p>He would then go on to become the first male CoverGirl (CoverBoy) which was a huge moment in the beauty industry. His social media essentially blew up, and he quickly gained millions of subscribers on the video channel in a few years. He would go on to collaborate with A-list <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars, from the Kardashians to music performers like Iggy Azalea.</p><p>Tati Westbrook is known as one of the original beauty bloggers who were on the platform before it became a social media staple. Starting back in 2010 she gained a lot of respect for honest reviews and tips on makeup and beauty.</p><p>Their friendship blossomed when James was starting out in the industry. Tati and her husband James took him under their wing, as the young teen at the time had moved thousands of miles from New York to Los Angeles.</p><p>She would support most of his endeavors, whether that was his makeup palette with Morphe, merch clothing and his makeup tour. However, it was apparently not reciprocated – which is where the fallout began.</p><p>In April 2019, James promotes SugarBearHair vitamins on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>. The problem was, it was a direct competitor of Tati’s company Halo Beauty, which also sold supplements. It doesn’t sit well with Tati, who later said she felt ‘used’ and ‘betrayed’.</p><p>James would later apologize, saying it was a major ‘oversight’ and said he supported her online and offline and takes her products daily. Then we wait for a few weeks, and one video changed everything.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bye-sister>Bye Sister</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The drama that broke YouTube. In May 2019, Tati uploaded a 43-minute-long video where she goes into detail on what went down over the vitamins from her perspective. She also claimed that James would try to pursue straight men with intense flirting.</p><p>James posts a response, apologizing to the pair for everything that has happened.</p><p>“I’ve been involved in a lot of very unique and strange situations that have left people confused or upset,” he says in the clip. He added: “I’ve learned the hard way about ways that I can interact with boys that I’m interested in and also ones that I should or shouldn’t be talking to.”</p><p>Then Jeffree steps in, tweeting James’ brother over him trying to talk to straight men.</p><p>Tati comes back days later with a new video, explaining why she started the drama with her clip. She said it was a “last-ditch effort” to help someone she loved. That’s when James steps up his game with a follow-up recording, called, ‘No More Lies’. James Charles combs through every single claim from Tati and Jeffree Star and pulls out receipts.</p><p>He came prepared.</p><p>Jeffree posts his own video, instead of stirring the pot, he admits he regrets sending James “vicious text messages”. He also says he “inserted himself into something” he shouldn’t have.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-you-think-it-s-all-over>When you think it’s all over</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-14.13.04-1024x532.png><p>Just as it settles down, June 2020 comes around fast when Tati returns with another bombshell video. She claims another influencer, <a href=#>Shane Dawson</a>, and Jeffree orchestrated the entire drama. Confused? So were we.</p><p>She claimed the duo were “bitterly jealous” of the success of James, and said Shane told her of the allegations which led to the infamous first video.</p><p>Jeffree stayed quiet, but Shane was filming a live reaction on Instagram watching the video and claimed it was false. He later deleted the clip as well as a tweet saying the same thing.</p><p>This year, James spoke out about the entire ordeal, begging to be uncanceled.</p><p>Fans believed the drama had finally simmered down, but it appears Jeffree is ready to start it up again with his recent thoughts.</p><p><strong>The Dumb Blonde Podcast is available on <a href=#>Spotify</a>. Jeffree’s episode will release on Wednesday, September 13.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2Z%2FcLbEn52rnZViwLWt0WapnqGXo7a1sdJmnLGonKTAqsLEZpurmZ2Weri106FkqKaVYsCmutOepZydXZbAbrTEZqqlmZ2oequtzJ6qZpuYlr%2BtsdJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeffree-star-reignites-explosive-drama-with-one-sentence-as-he-slams-james-charles.html&text=Jeffree%20Star%20reignites%20explosive%20drama%20with%20one%20sentence%20as%20he%20slams%20James%20Charles&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeffree-star-reignites-explosive-drama-with-one-sentence-as-he-slams-james-charles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeffree-star-reignites-explosive-drama-with-one-sentence-as-he-slams-james-charles.html&title=Jeffree%20Star%20reignites%20explosive%20drama%20with%20one%20sentence%20as%20he%20slams%20James%20Charles" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeffree-star-reignites-explosive-drama-with-one-sentence-as-he-slams-james-charles.html&title=Jeffree%20Star%20reignites%20explosive%20drama%20with%20one%20sentence%20as%20he%20slams%20James%20Charles" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeffree-star-reignites-explosive-drama-with-one-sentence-as-he-slams-james-charles.html&title=Jeffree%20Star%20reignites%20explosive%20drama%20with%20one%20sentence%20as%20he%20slams%20James%20Charles" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeffree-star-reignites-explosive-drama-with-one-sentence-as-he-slams-james-charles.html&description=Jeffree%20Star%20reignites%20explosive%20drama%20with%20one%20sentence%20as%20he%20slams%20James%20Charles" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./park-bo-gum-suzy-and-shin-dong-yup-to-reunite-for-hosting-60th-baeksang-arts-awards-marking-6th-consecutive-year-1295595.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Park Bo Gum, Suzy and Shin Dong Yup to reunite for hosting 60th Baeksang Arts Awards marking 6th con">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./article-c4ef1e42-fca4-11e8-9deb-d3ae7ff4832b-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Mitchell Calloway | Obituaries">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
