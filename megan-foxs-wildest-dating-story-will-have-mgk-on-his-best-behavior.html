The two have been together ever since meeting on the set of their <a href=#>movie</a>, Midnight in The Switchgrass in 2020.

She said she had a habit of falling for “every new costar” in the early days.</p><p>Megan confessed: “I was addicted to falling in love, and I think I probably hurt a lot of people in that process too because a lot of people have been in love with me and I did not respect or honor that.”</p><p>However, she revealed everything changed when she became a mother to her three children.</p><p>The actress has three sons, Noah Shannon, 11, Bodhi Ransom, 9, and Journey River, 7, whom she shares with her ex-husband, Brian Austin Green.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> had an ‘on-off relationship’ from 2004-2009, before getting married in 2010.

MGK, but before that, she dated a couple of Hollywood stars, starting with 7th Heaven actor,<strong> </strong>David Gallagher.</p><p>The two dated from 2003-2004, when her career first kicked off. However, it was fairly short-lived.</p><p>She was then rumored to be dating Transformers co-star, Shia LaBeouf, in the mid 2000s, although they kept it on the down low.</p><p>In a 2018 interview on Watch What Happens Live, she confirmed the past ‘showmance’ by saying: “Um, I mean, I would confirm it was romantic. I love him, I’ve never been really private about that. I love him.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aCcLnEoJinZZakxbR51qKjnZ2jqXqlrdOipaBlo6m8s8WMsKClpF2drrexjKaepGWfo3qptdJmmZ6rpGKvprTAr6Coql8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmegan-foxs-wildest-dating-story-will-have-mgk-on-his-best-behavior.html&text=Megan%20Fox%27s%20%27wildest%20dating%20story%27%20will%20have%20MGK%20on%20his%20best%20behavior&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmegan-foxs-wildest-dating-story-will-have-mgk-on-his-best-behavior.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmegan-foxs-wildest-dating-story-will-have-mgk-on-his-best-behavior.html&title=Megan%20Fox%27s%20%27wildest%20dating%20story%27%20will%20have%20MGK%20on%20his%20best%20behavior" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmegan-foxs-wildest-dating-story-will-have-mgk-on-his-best-behavior.html&title=Megan%20Fox%27s%20%27wildest%20dating%20story%27%20will%20have%20MGK%20on%20his%20best%20behavior" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmegan-foxs-wildest-dating-story-will-have-mgk-on-his-best-behavior.html&title=Megan%20Fox%27s%20%27wildest%20dating%20story%27%20will%20have%20MGK%20on%20his%20best%20behavior" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmegan-foxs-wildest-dating-story-will-have-mgk-on-his-best-behavior.html&description=Megan%20Fox%27s%20%27wildest%20dating%20story%27%20will%20have%20MGK%20on%20his%20best%20behavior" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tencent-music-vp-lixue-shi-announces-his-resignation-from-the-company.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tencent Music VP Lixue Shi Announces His Resignation From The Company">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-anise-went-medicinal-plant-raki-sambuca-ouzo-and-pastis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How anise went from medicinal plant to raki, sambuca, ouzo and pastis ingredient">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
