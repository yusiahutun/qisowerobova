Good thing there's a huge difference between school and MasterClass.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MasterClass is an online library with over 100 classes across 11 different categories featuring topics like makeup and fashion design taught by living legends, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="afftrack=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">Anna Wintour</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="afftrack=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">Diane von Furstenberg</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Bobbi Brown</a>.

Each plan comes with access to all classes, a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, bonus guides and content, and a variety of streaming options (computer, TV, phone, and tablet). Although MasterClass doesn't have free trials, the 30-day satisfaction guarantee allows you to get your money back if it's not the right fit for you. If this is the case for you, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow">submit a request</a> to the MasterClass Support Team.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One difference between the plans is that Duo and Family members can download classes for offline viewing. This is an excellent perk for those who travel often or don't always have access to Wi-Fi. Another feature the Individual plan doesn't include is the ability to watch lessons on multiple devices at the same time. Duo members can be logged in on two different devices, while Family members can watch MasterClass on six different devices at once. The upgraded plans make the most sense for families or small groups that want to access classes simultaneously on their own smart gadgets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sign up: </strong>$180–$276/year; <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">masterclass.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-popular-masterclass-classes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Most Popular MasterClass Classes</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MasterClass covers a huge variety of topics.

Luckily, the MasterClass website and app is extremely user-friendly. As someone with a busy schedule, I oftentimes had to log off in the middle of a lesson. Thankfully, it was never an issue because MasterClass has a section called "My Progress" where you can resume the video right where you left off.

I always think I'm going to remember information, but these notes ensure I won't forget. MasterClass also has extensive downloadable guides for each class that provide valuable information you can keep forever. After each lesson, you can give it a rating out of five stars.

Then I found some on cooking — I don't cook — but I enjoyed seeing how it's done... You get the idea: The learning never ends. Outstanding instructors, excellent set-up, and good ancillary materials for review.

Also, people who love watching documentaries, exploring new hobbies, and expanding their knowledge will love MasterClass. It offers inspiration, guidance, expert tips, and real-life experiences to help you grow in your career and personal life.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-isnt-it-good-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_178-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Isn't It Good For?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_179-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I wouldn't recommend MasterClass to people who'd rather read paper copies of information than watch video lessons. Also, it's not a great investment for people who don't enjoy learning new things or who don't have interest in a variety of subjects.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_181-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_182-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Without a doubt, MasterClass is worth the money. At just $15 a month, you get access to more than 100 classes from some of the most knowledgeable people in the world. Whether you learn about subjects that help you grow in your career or as a person, choosing to sign up for MasterClass is choosing to invest in yourself.
