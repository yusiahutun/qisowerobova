wig.<br></span></p><p><span>Her hazel eyes and bright red lipstick against the backdrop of the blue sea reveals the singer's beauty in a light never before seen.<br></span></p><p><span>But of course, Rihanna would not be happy unless she got an edgy shot in there and a very close up shot of the S&M hit-maker with a snarling glare shows the singer always wants to ensure she brings a bit of naughty with her nice.<br></span></p><p><span>These pictures were published on the day she emerged from the same restaurant as Farrell who she is rumoured to be in a close friendship with.<br></span></p><p><span>The pair did not want to be photographed together so came out of Santa Monica eatery Giorgio Baldi separately last night.<br></span></p><p><span>Rihanna looked demure, by her standards, in black cropped trousers and a silver blouse.<br></span></p><p><span>Her curly red hair made sure she was noticed though as she exited the Italian restaurant.<br></span></p><p><span>Farrell meanwhile, looked rather sheepish as he made a quick dash out wearing jeans and a black T-shirt.<br></span></p><p><span>It has been reported in recent weeks that the pair have been sending flirty text messages to each other.<br></span></p><p><span>The Sun claims that Farrell, 34 has 'worked his charms on Rihanna to such an extent she hasn't stopped texting him', since they swapped numbers earlier this year when they both appeared on The Graham Norton Show in the UK.</span></p><img
