In this book review of <strong><a href=#>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</a></strong>, you’ll learn about the all-important contributions cadavers have made to the fields of medicine, vehicle safety, and forensics, among others, as well as some of the more absurd situations they have ended up in.</p><p>A look at the unsung (and unliving) heroes of science and medicine.</p><p>READ THIS BOOK REVIEW IF YOU:</p><ul><li>Want to donate your body to science</li><li>Are interested in the study of anatomy</li><li>Like strange and slightly macabre stories</li></ul><p class=toc_title>Table of Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#>A Head Is a Terrible Thing to Waste</a></li><li><a href=#>Crimes of Anatomy</a></li><li><a href=#>Life After Death</a></li><li><a href=#>Dead Man Driving</a></li><li><a href=#>Beyond the Black Box</a></li><li><a href=#>The Cadaver Who Joined the Army</a></li><li><a href=#>Holy Cadaver</a></li><li><a href=#>How to Know If You’re Dead</a></li><li><a href=#>Just a Head</a></li><li><a href=#>Eat Me</a></li><li><a href=#>Out of the Fire, Into the Compost Bin</a></li><li><a href=#>Remains of the Author</a></li><li><a href=#>About the author</a></li><li><a href=#>Genres</a></li><li><a href=#>Table of Contents</a></li><li><a href=#>Review</a></li></ul><h2 id=Introduction><span id=Introduction>Introduction</span></h2><p>The most important thing to remember about cadavers is that although they look like people, they aren’t. They are what’s left behind when the people pass away. And while dying involves many difficult emotions — love, anger, grief, fear — being dead is a completely different stage in the body’s existence.</p><p>Many people like the idea of their body serving a useful purpose after they die, and author Mary Roach sees no disrespect in describing those purposes. Cadavers have taught us anatomy, enabled the success of heart transplants, and helped design safer automobiles. Cadavers can be run over, shot, and operated on without suffering, making them incredibly useful to a society that needs to test surgical procedures and new technology in an ethical way.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8Dpbu5UdcI43dxPw4jXpSYhM155RQDDVQ8sZLG93EpXo3v3izXs0pPLTdNvBiT-f8aQO_p-PsWk2UtLtHilRyExKINZWDmZWGjNBpCu5ZJSR19G1sixORAUjSSARvKWIQWn0M2MAeZjtS-pU9zj8nbqew=w546-h820-s-no?authuser=0" alt="Book Review: Stiff - The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers" width=546 height=820 data-no-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2 id=Head><span id=A_Head_Is_a_Terrible_Thing_to_Waste>A Head Is a Terrible Thing to Waste</span></h2><p>In an anatomy lab at a university medical center, severed heads are laid out in aluminum pans on soothing lavender tablecloths. They’re being operated on by plastic surgeons practicing for face-lifts and reconstructive surgeries. Faces and hands can be the hardest cadaver body parts to work with, emotionally, because they’re the parts of a person we see and interact with the most when the person is alive. But at the same time, the surgeons are thrilled to have a chance to practice on a face that won’t scrutinize itself in the mirror later on.</p><p>The standard procedure in hospitals for training new surgeons is to have them watch actual surgeries in the operating room, and assist with more and more complicated operations. But many patients these days resist the idea of a less-thanex-pert hand working with their insides, and training is becoming trickier. Medical schools are turning to cadavers for help.</p><p>We’ve come a long way from the “operating theaters” of the 19th century and previous, where the surgery was primarily for the benefit of the audience; whether the patient survived was somewhat incidental. Only the poor and desperate offered themselves up to the unanesthetized horrors of the operating theater.</p><h2 id=Crimes><span id=Crimes_of_Anatomy>Crimes of Anatomy</span></h2><p>The field of anatomy has a long history of taking advantage of the poor and otherwise disadvantaged. Until fairly recently, donating one’s body to science was not a common practice. In Britain, before 1836, it was illegal to dissect any human body except those of executed murderers. Dissection was in fact believed to be a punishment worse than death, because it decreased one’s chances of getting into heaven. As interest in the study of medicine increased in the 1700s and 1800s and the number of medical schools grew, dead bodies became a precious commodity.</p><p>Anatomists fell back on some unsavory methods for getting bodies to practice on: raiding graveyards. In 1828 in England, one gang of “resurrectionists” dug up 312 bodies. One pair of notorious criminals even started murdering people and selling their bodies. The leader of the team was eventually hanged and then sent to be dissected himself.</p><p>Unlike their historical counterparts, modern cadavers are treated respectfully and even given memorial services with moving tributes. In the last 50 years, donating one’s body has become more and more common, due perhaps in equal part to altruism and the high cost of funerals. But dissection may no longer be necessary for anatomy students; in 1993 a 3D digital model was created from almost 2,000 photographs of a dissected corpse. And as the field of medicine grows, medical students no longer have time to spend hours learning hands-on what they could more easily see onscreen.</p><h2 id=Life><span id=Life_After_Death>Life After Death</span></h2><p>Dissection, stomach-turning as it may be for some, is arguably not the grossest thing that could happen to a body after death. During the normal process of decay, liquids loosen the skin, gases cause bloating, the brain dribbles out the ears, and eventually hard-working bacteria liquify all the body’s tissues, leaving the skeleton in a puddle. If the body is exposed to the world, flies and their larvae and meateating beetles help the process along.</p><p>The stages of decay have been comprehensively studied by scientists in the service of forensics, to give police investigators accurate information about how long a murder victim or mysterious corpse has been dead. Temperature can be used for the first few hours — a dead body cools by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit each hour until it hits the ambient temperature. Afterward, more-sophisticated analysis is called for, one that measures the levels of certain time-sensitive decay chemicals. Research labs study how the process of decay changes if the body is buried versus left in the open, or shut in a car trunk versus bundled into a bag.</p><p>A different kind of dead-body professional tries to keep the body from decaying. Embalmers pump preserving fluids through the body’s circulatory system and clean up any leaks from the inside as they ready a body for funeral viewing. Embalming hit the bigtime in our society just a century and a half ago, during the Civil War, to enable dead soldiers to be sent home to their families in recognizable form. Even embalming, though, only delays the inevitable.</p><h2 id=Dead><span id=Dead_Man_Driving>Dead Man Driving</span></h2><p>In a Michigan university lab, researchers prop up a cadaver in a seat, mimicking the position of a car driver. Then they fire a piston that slams into the body’s shoulder. Later an autopsy will assess the damage, and the information will help design safer cars.</p><p>Cadavers have a long history in helping out with automobile safety; they’re the only way to assess the impact of a crash on a human body without causing anyone any pain. Crash test dummies can be used to measure the force of an impact, but that information is only useful if you know the damage threshold for an actual body.</p><p>Impact research on cadavers has shaped dashboards and steering wheels and has influenced the design of seatbelts and windshields. One article estimates that this research has saved more than a quarter million lives in the last 30 years.</p><p>Current research focuses on side-impact crashes — which are now much more dangerous than head-on collisions, since there’s only a couple of inches of car door to absorb the impact — and impact studies of the body’s extremities. Thanks to modern car technology, people are surviving previously fatal levels of car crash, but with severe damage to their knees or ankles.</p><p>The current cadaver-testing situation, however, is unable to generate answers to one of the most important issues in automobile safety: the effect of impacts on children’s bodies. No one wants to ask grieving parents for their child’s body, so animals like baboons are used instead, but the results are not really accurate, and animal rights advocates are not happy.</p><h2 id=Beyond><span id=Beyond_the_Black_Box>Beyond the Black Box</span></h2><p>When a plane crashes leaving no survivors, investigators can discover the reason for the crash from the flight recorder — often called the “black box” — or from the wrecked pieces of the plane itself. When a plane goes down into the ocean, however, the black box may be lost along with most of the wreckage. When this happens, as with TWA Flight 800 that came apart above the Atlantic in July 1966, the only evidence is what floats — most usefully, the bodies of the passengers and crew.</p><p>The bodies are examined by an injury analyst, whose job it is to solve the mystery of the crash based on the condition of the corpses. The injury analyst brought in for the Flight 800 case was able to rule out a bomb because most of the bodies were intact and displayed no noticeable patterns of shrapnel such as a bomb would inflict. The bodies had chemical burns on their backs, from jet fuel in the water, but not on their fronts, contradicting speculation that a missile had been involved.</p><p>Further examination of the bodies suggested that there had been a fire in the cabin, but that the passengers had been thrown clear fairly quickly. Many of their injuries — broken ribs, punctured lungs, and torn aortas — were consistent with the damage that occurs from extreme impact with water.</p><p>Based on this analysis, authorities guessed that a fuel tank in one of the wings had exploded, and this theory was later confirmed with recovered fragments of the plane.</p><p>One of the first injury analyses, of a British airliner that went down in 1954, noted that half the passengers were clothed, while half were mostly naked. A team of investigators dropped dummies into the sea to confirm their theory: that passengers in the front of the plane were thrown free and had their clothes blown off by the impact with the water, while the passengers in the rear were still in the plane when it crashed into the sea.</p><h2 id=Cadaver><span id=The_Cadaver_Who_Joined_the_Army>The Cadaver Who Joined the Army</span></h2><p>Around the turn of the 20th century, the US tested the effects of bullets by firing them at dead bodies. In part their goal was to study the bullet holes to improve medical treatment for wounded soldiers. But they were also interested in what is called “stopping power.” Already-dead bodies turned out not to be very useful for measuring the stopping power of a bullet, however, and later tests were conducted on cows.</p><p>It turns out, though, that a bullet’s power to knock someone down may depend on the victim’s awareness of the bullet’s power. Deer often run for 40 or 50 yards after being shot in the heart; a human can collapse just from hearing a gunshot.</p><p>A competing theory holds that a bullet can cause a “neural overload,” causing the body to collapse. The theory suggests that the neural overload is trigger by the moment of impact, when a cavity briefly opens around the bullet. Modern testing facilities use clear gelatin-based substance to simulate human tissue.</p><p>Most ballistics-testing labs avoid working with cadavers out of concern for the public response. Whether they’re testing a bullet’s efficacy in stopping someone or testing an armored vest’s ability to stop the bullet, they don’t want to be shooting at an actual body. One lab did use cadavers to test the ability of a variety of footwear to protect their wearers against landmines. However, cadavers are usually old enough that the results of a test may not hold for a younger body.</p><h2 id=Holy><span id=Holy_Cadaver>Holy Cadaver</span></h2><p>In 1931, a priest attended a medical conference in France, looking for medical assistance in determining the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, which was said to be Jesus’ burial shroud. A doctor named Pierre Barbet took on the assignment with enthusiasm, and he developed a variety of theories that showed that yes, the red smears on the shroud matched the likely position of a body on a cross. To prove his points, he tacked up a corpse on a cross. But then he started wondering if the nails might have been put through Jesus’s wrists rather than his hands. While experimenting with this theory, he nailed up a total of 13 amputated arms.</p><p>Some tests have suggested that the “blood” on the shroud is actually paint. A recent study tied live volunteers to a wooden cross with leather straps and disproved several of Barbet’s ideas. The authenticity of the shroud remains in question.</p><h2 id=Know><span id=How_to_Know_If_Youre_Dead>How to Know If You’re Dead</span></h2><p>Ancient Egyptians believed that the spirit resided in the heart, and when they mummified a corpse, they removed all the other organs but left the heart. Babylonians, on the other hand, believed the soul made its home in the liver. Classical Greek thought divided the soul between the heart and the brain.</p><p>For centuries, death was measured as the moment the heart stops. But modern legal and medical definitions draw the line between life and death in the brain. When the brain dies, the body can no longer survive on its own.</p><p>If you connect the body to an artificial respirator, however, the heart will go on beating after the brain is dead, and the other organs also will survive for several days. These beating-heart cadavers are the donors for the modern miracle of organ transplants. They’re wheeled into the operating room with their blood still flowing, their skin warm, and their torso opened up. The organs are surgically removed and sent to save the lives of people with living brains but malfunctioning hearts, livers, or kidneys.</p><p>The waiting list for donated organs is tens of thousands long, but families often blanch at the idea of sending their loved one away with heart still beating. The idea of the heart as the core of our being still pervades our culture and consciousness. The recipients of heart transplants often describe powerful feelings of otherness, of feelings or memories that aren’t theirs. But according to one transplant surgeon, those memories never correspond with the actual identity of the donor.</p><h2 id=Just><span id=Just_a_Head>Just a Head</span></h2><p>The guillotine was invented in France as a more humane alternative to hanging. But critics protested that death by the falling blade was not actually instantaneous, that the severed heads could be seen to grimace and move in the basket. Nineteenth-century French scientists undertook a number of unsuccessful experiments to revive decapitated heads by injecting blood into the arteries.</p><p>Around the turn of the 20th century, one physician attending a execution in Paris observed that when he called the name of the man who had just been guillotined, the head in the basket opened its eyes and focused on his face. A few years later, organ-transplant pioneers Charles Guthrie and Alexis Carrel began to experiment with splicing extra heads onto dogs.</p><p>It is now known that the brain remains conscious for 10 or 12 seconds once its blood supply has been cut off, and final death doesn’t occur until six to 10 minutes have passed. The first head-attaching surgeries lasted too long, and the head retained only basic reflexive movements. Experiments in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, however, yielded two-headed dogs apparently with full brain function, although none of them lived longer than a month.</p><p>In 1971, American neurosurgeon Robert White successfully transplanted a head from one rhesus monkey to another. The monkeys didn’t live very long, but White says there’s no reason human heads couldn’t be transplanted as well. He thinks of it as a total body transplant. There have been actual people interested in the idea, but no one wants to go first.</p><h2 id=Eat><span id=Eat_Me>Eat Me</span></h2><p>Humans have a long history of using bits of other people’s bodies to enhance their own health. From tubs of blood (bathed in, to cure leprosy) to human flesh preserved for 100 years in honey (eaten, to heal wounds or broken bones), bits of the human body have been prescribed to cure practically every ailment.</p><p>Nor are these the least appealing treatments in a list that includes a phosphorescent extract of fecal matter and strips of dried human skin. Medicines made from mummies were so popular in the 1700s that apothecaries were making their own mummies by wrapping bodies in bandages and pitch, and drying them in ovens.</p><p>Nowadays, of course, life-saving medicines like insulin and other hormonal treatments are extracted from the bodies of animals, or synthetically made. Modern medicines differ from the nostrums of history not as much in concept as in effectiveness.</p><p>In some parts of the world, the human body is still considered to have powerful healing properties. Hospitals in China, for example, sell supplements made from aborted fetuses. If this sounds barbaric to you, consider that several Western pregnancy websites recommend eating the placenta to prevent postpartum depression. These websites offer recipes that incorporate placenta into pizza, lasagna and cocktails.</p><p>Is there a difference between eating nutritious pieces of plants and eating nutritious pieces of humans? Between accepting a heart transplant and accepting a piece of roasted heart?</p><h2 id=Fire><span id=Out_of_the_Fire_Into_the_Compost_Bin>Out of the Fire, Into the Compost Bin</span></h2><p>A traditional Christian burial, with a casket and a cemetery plot and all those flowers, costs a lot. A variety of alternatives has been suggested over the years, but the only one that reached the mainstream was incineration. Cremation has become more and more common since 1963, the year that both the Catholic ban on burning bodies was lifted and Jessica Mitford’s exposé of the funeral business, The American Way of Death, was published.</p><p>Other, less popular proposals for skipping the lavish burial and putting people to use after they die have included making leather out of human skin, burning human fat in lamps, and chopping up and drying bodies to use a fertilizer.</p><p>The lack of dignity in these processes was probably their deathknell, but the idea of making compost from human remains is still around. A Swedish company called Promessa is promoting a process it calls an “ecological funeral,” which involves freezing a body, shattering it, and freeze-drying it. The result material is rich in nutrients and perfect for planting a memorial tree or shrub in. (The ash that results from cremation, on the other hand, has very little value as plant food.)</p><p>Promessa’s motivation is mainly environmental. Cremation is an energy-intensive process, and concerns have also been raised about the vaporized mercury from tooth fillings. Promessa’s founders want to provide people with the opportunity to truly give themselves back to earth.</p><h2 id=Remains><span id=Remains_of_the_Author>Remains of the Author</span></h2><p>It’s no longer possible to become the classic brain on display in a jar or a morbidly elegant skeleton in a classroom. At the Harvard Brain Bank, for example, brains are sliced and frozen in plastic tubs, and bone-research facilities keep their bones unconnected to each other.</p><p>The University of Michigan Medical School does have a plastination lab, where bodies are permanently preserved through a process that replaces water with a silicone polymer. Traveling museum exhibits have been made from plastinated bodies.</p><p>If you donate your body to science, you don’t have a say in whether you end up in an anatomy class or in the driver’s seat of a simulated car crash. But should you even get to decide whether to donate your body in the first place? Your family members are the ones dealing with the whole situation, and if it would add to their distress to think anatomy students are poking around in your insides, do you have the right to force that choice on them?</p><p>Roach has decided that she’ll let her family make the choice after she’s gone, with one stipulation: If her organs are in good shape, someone else should have them. If she’s the donor for a heart transplant, we can only hope that memory transfer truly is a myth, and that the recipient won’t wake up with unexpected memories of a lot of cadavers.</p><h2 id=About><span id=About_the_author>About the author</span></h2><p><a href=#><strong>Mary Roach</strong>’s</a> articles have been published in Wired, National Geographic, and The New York Times Magazine.
