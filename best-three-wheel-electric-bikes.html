In fact, there are many three wheel bikes! Trikes or ‘adult tricycles’ are unbeatable when it comes to offering a stable ride. Because of their structure, they require minimal, if any, effort to balance. This single feature makes them very attractive to older adults and those with limited mobility.</p><p>Similar to the <a href=# rel=noopener>best electric bikes for women</a>, three wheel electric bikes are extra special because they offer a kick of power. They’re equipped with battery operated motors that make it easier to go up hills.</p><p>Again, if you have foot pain or bad knees, opting for a trike with some juice can help you get back out on the road. You can still bike manually, but also have the option of pedaling with the motor (referred to as pedal assist), or going fully electric.</p><p>The higher the motor watt (350 and up) the easier you’ll move up steeper inclines. However, this isn’t to say that these bikes are good for just hills. They’re also great for cruising through town and getting your errands done. The best three wheel electric bikes include rear baskets, headlights, and button-based throttles that make an already fun experience exhilarating.</p><p>A great example of this is the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">EVRYjourney Electric Hybrid Tricycle</a></strong>. I’m obsessed with its color options, the accessible step-thru frame, and that is has a thumb throttle to control the motor’s power. It’s made by <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Sixthreezero</a></strong>, which has a super user-friendly site. If going through specs and bike heights overwhelms you, I highly recommend starting your shopping with them. They make the process easy,</p><p>When shopping for your three wheel electric bike, pay attention to how far it can go between charges. If you want to take long rides, something like the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">3SCORE Electric Fat Trike</a></strong>, which can zoom up to 45 miles, may be a good option. In contrast, if you’re more interested in something just to take you to the corner store and back, the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Viribus Adult Electric Tricycle</a></strong> can go 22 miles between charges, and is under $1,000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are electric tricycles safe?</h2><p>If you’ve avoided electric bikes because you’re afraid they have too much pep, an electric tricycle is a great option. For one thing, they’re easier to balance and control, which greatly cuts down your risk of injury. E-bike users also tend to ride conservatively.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Portland State University</a>, those with electric bicycles only went 3 miles per hour faster than conventional bikers. In some settings, traditional cyclists actually out-pedaled them. Although a reason wasn’t given for this, it could be that electric bike owners are more cautious since they know how fast they can go. This might lead to them being safer bikers.</p><p>Three wheel electric bikes can make you feel like a kid — in a good way — but have the type of safety features grownups love. For example, the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">CozyTrike Adult Electric Tricycle</a>,</strong> has an advanced breaking system, and front suspension to help tires maintain surface contact. It also comes with an extra-large rear basket, which technically has nothing to do with safety, but makes the trike superb at carting groceries home.</p><p>You’re not required to have a special license or insurance to operate an electric bike. However, you still need to remain alert to your environment. Some of the best three wheel electric bikes, like the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">M-340 Electric Fat Trike</a></strong>, have thick puncture-resistant tires that are excellent at gripping the road. You can also step through the frame, which is great if you don’t have full range of motion.</p><p>Like all bikes, three wheel electric bikes offer many health benefits. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation</a>, cycling can help reduce muscle loss in seniors. And according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Harvard Medical School</a>, getting outside for just 20 minutes daily is enough to improve your mood, lower anxiety, and reduce blood pressure.</p><p>Operating an electric bike can take some time getting used to. It may be helpful to practice on a flat, non-busy area, where you can become accustomed to the throttle, and the bike’s overall operation. Go slow, and then once you’re familiar with all the settings, you can speed things up.</p><p>It goes without saying that you should always wear a <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">bike helmet</a></strong>. Although most of the best three wheel electric bikes will include an electric horn and lights, the rules of the road still apply!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does a motorized tricycle cost?</h2><p>Three wheel electric bikes average between $1,500 and $3,000. If that sounds pricey, you may be glad to know that these bikes last a long time. According to <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Sixthreezero</a></strong>, bike motors last up to five years. Interestingly, motors tend to be extra durable, lasting 10,000 miles or longer. Tires, chains, and breaks should be checked out for wear and tear every 3,000 miles or so.</p><p>Considering that traditional bikes need their break pads changed every 1,000 miles, it’s not hard to see that electric trikes are actually affordable. They’re safer than two-wheelers, awesome for those with balance issues, and make transporting things super easy. It not a surprise that so many want them.</p><p>Looking for even more options?

Adjust the recumbent seat, turn the key, and speed away to your favorite local spots. The bike features a chain and crank system for easier pedaling, and if you use pedal-assist instead of straight electric, you can go up to 25 miles. Miss your turn? Press the reverse button on the handlebar, and allow the front suspension to smoothly move you around. There’s an advance breaking system in case a furry little squirrel dashes across your path, and the step-thru frame makes this super easy to climb in and out of.</p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>CozyTrike Specs:</h3><ul><li>Up to 25 miles</li><li>20 mph</li><li>4 hour charge time</li><li>400 pound weight capacity</li><li>1,000 watt motor</li><li>Dimensions: 60L x 28W</li></ul><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>“The throttle system is incredibly easy to use, and the motor is very effective and quick…You can pedal and just keep the throttle light, or let the thing zip about.

It can go up to 20 miles per hour, and has a 350 watt motor, which is fast enough to ride circles around your friends. There are four levels of pedal-assist, each that can be controlled through the handlebars. The bike also has index shifting, allowing you to smoothly transition from one gear into the next. Personally, I would use this bike for weekly trips to the library — don’t those baskets look like they’re begging to be filled with books? But you can also use it to visit your favorite clothes boutiques, outdoor markets, and everywhere else.</p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Buzz specs:</h3><ul><li>350 watt motor</li><li>Up to 40 miles</li><li>20mph</li><li>2 to 6 hour charge time</li><li>Pallet and box dimensions: 60L x 40W X 34H</li></ul><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>“I could no longer ride my touring bike, because of some balance issues.

Best for flat surfaces, the 350 watt motor can take you up to 35 miles before you have to take a recharging break. You can drive up to 15 miles per hour, which is fastish, but not so fast you’ll feel like you’re speeding out of control. A front electric light gives visibility on evening outings, and large fenders keep you from getting splashed if you cycle through puddles.</p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>DWMEIGI specs:</h3><ul><li>350 watt motor</li><li>Up to 35 miles</li><li>2 to 5 hour charge</li><li>15mph</li></ul><p><strong>Product review:</strong> “Five stars all around. It’s exactly what I hoped it would be — perfect for running errands around the neighborhood. The price is definitely right…I’m recovering from a stroke, and I don’t have the balance to ride a bike anymore. I highly recommend this trike to anyone in similar circumstances. It has really freed me up, and helps me get some exercise. Plus, I look cool on it, and it’s definitely a conversation starter.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">VIRIBUS Electric Trike Bike</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best 3 wheel electric bike with back basket</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Untitled-design-2022-03-14T180611.706.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart , $764.39</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Great for larger riders</li><li>Up to 65 miles</li><li>Integrated headlights</li></ul><p>Cruise the day away with the Viribus Adult Electric Tricycle.
