HELB (Higher Education Loans Board) is a government department that offers loans, bursaries, and scholarships for Kenyan higher education students. The loans are designed to help disadvantaged students achieve their dreams of fishing their education and starting a career. So, how can you apply for one?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/97d3ec51793b267b.jpg><p class=align-left>If you have never applied for a HELB loan before, the process might be daunting. Below, we have compiled all the information you need to start the process – from requirements to application forms, disbursement, and repayment.</p><h2>Types of HELB loans</h2><p class=align-left>Did you know that there are several types of HELB loans? Depending on your situation, the following are some of the bursaries you can consider:</p><h3>Undergraduate loans</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Undergraduate loans</a> are what most people have in mind whenever the phrase "HELB loan" is mentioned. It is government financial aid offered to students joining recognised undergraduate institutions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/97d3ec51793b267b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>HELB Jielimishe loan for salaried students requirements, application</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The loans are usually offered to direct entry students who gained admission through the <a href=#>KUCCPS</a> (Kenyan Universities and Colleges Placement Services). However, direct-entry students who are self-sponsored and attending a recognised institution offering undergraduate courses can also apply.</p><p class=align-left>Anyone meeting the eligibility criteria can apply for the loan. However, approval is not guaranteed, and some applicants might not get it. Instead, priority is given to needy and disadvantaged applicants such as orphans, single families, families experiencing financial hardships, etc.</p><h3>TVET loans</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TVET loans </a>are a HELB bursary offered to students attending <a href=#>TVET</a> (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) institutions. In other words, higher education students pursuing artisan, certificate, or diploma courses in recognised institutions.</p><p class=align-left>Like with the undergraduate bursaries, approval is not guaranteed. However, orphans, students from single families, poor backgrounds, or any other hardship situation are given a preference.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/92f296dddd0b5a12.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best NGO scholarship for poor students in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>Jielimishe loans</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jielimishe loans </a>are HELB loans offered to salaried students in recognised institutions. These include those who are pursuing professional, undergraduate, and postgraduate studies. Unlike the other two types of HELB bursaries, they have different features such as:</p><ul><li>Faster loan processing</li><li>Higher interest rates (10%)</li><li>Monthly repayments while studying</li><li>Higher loan amounts (up to 600,000)</li></ul><p class=align-left>Eligibility is also different in that the loan is offered to students who are employees of the civil service, parastatals, public commissions, and public universities. Employees of a select number of private companies are also considered.</p><h2>What are the requirements for the HELB loan application?</h2><p class=align-left>What do you need to apply for a HELB loan? Below is a look at some of the things you might be asked for:</p><ul><li>A letter of admission from a recognised university, college, or technical/vocational training institute in Kenya</li><li>A copy of your national identity card</li><li>Copies of your parents/guardians national ID cards (in case the parent or guardian is deceased, a death certificate is required)</li><li>Copies of national ID cards for two individuals who will act as your guarantor</li><li>A copy of the KCSE certificate or result slip</li><li>Passport size photograph (applicant)</li><li>Banking/ATM card details (usually asked of KUCCPS students)</li><li>A copy of your institution's smart card or ID card</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6565e845d6ce2aed.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is KUCCPS, and what does it do for students?</span></p></a><h2>How to apply for a HELB bursary for the first time?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/92f296dddd0b5a12.jpg><p class=align-left>There are two types of applications, first time and subsequent application. Below is a look at the first time application process step-by-step:</p><ul><li>Go to the HELB portal and click on the student portal link (found on the menu bar at the top of the page)</li><li>Click on the Sign Up icon to create an account (provide the required information such as ID number, name, nationality, date of birth, etc. to complete registration)</li><li>Once you have created and verified your account, log in and go to the application section.</li><li>Choose the appropriate application form – Undergraduate First Time Loan Application Form (LAF) for undergraduate loans or HELB TVET bursary application form for TVET loans.</li><li>Read and/or watch the resources on the application section on how to fill the forms, HELB loans, and the application procedure to familiarise yourself with the process.</li><li>Fill the form by providing accurate information as asked of you</li><li>Download two copies of the form</li><li>Sign the form, and have it signed or stamped by relevant individuals or authorities as directed</li><li>Attach all the required documents on one of the forms the drop/send it to HELB Student Service Center at Anniversary Towers in Nairobi.

You will still need to apply for subsequent loans every year. Fortunately, the second and subsequent times are hassle-free as you can do it through a mobile app. Here is a look at how to apply:</p><ul><li>Go to Google Play Store and download the HELB mobile loan app</li><li>Launch the app and register an account using your accurate personal details (name, phone number, email, ID no. and KRA pin)</li><li>Go to the Loans section and select the right loan application form</li><li>Fill the form, then click submit. Once submitted, you will receive a notification of your successful application process.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The mobile app process is only available to <a href=#>Safaricom</a> mobile users. If you use any other mobile network provider, you can still apply through the HELB website. However, you must fill, print, and send the form to HELB offices.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4b9d2654860fa04b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>HELB Portal: Account registration and activation process guide</span></p></a><h2>HELB bursary disbursement and repayment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6565e845d6ce2aed.jpg><p class=align-left>Once you have sent the HELB bursary application form, it undergoes a review and approval process. If approved, the money is disbursed to you. The amount awarded is dependent on your financial situation and the programme being studied – between Ksh 37,000 and up to a maximum of Ksh 60,000.</p><p class=align-left>Disbursement is different depending on your admission status (government-sponsored or self-sponsored). All the awarded loan amount for self-sponsored students is sent to the institution of study to cover tuition fees. However, for government-sponsored students, Ksh 4,000 is sent to the institution every semester, with the rest going to the student's bank account.</p><p class=align-left>The money in the government-sponsored bank account is designed to cater for tuition, accommodation, books and other materials, and sustenance. It is highly advised not to use the money for other unnecessary purposes such as leisure or gambling.</p><h2>HELB bursary interest rate and repayment</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5f296edab2dad1c6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of top colleges in Nairobi</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The undergraduate and TVET loans are charged a low-interest rate of 4% per annum. You are given a grace period during your years of study and a further one year after graduating.</p><p class=align-left>During the one-year grace period, you are required to find a job and start <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">repaying your loan</a>. Loan repayments are supposed to be made monthly, a failure to which a penalty of Ksh 5,000 is applied for every unpaid month.</p><p class=align-left>HELB bursary loans are an excellent way to cover your tuition and other education-related expenses. As long as you are admitted to a recognised institution, you can apply for the HELB loans and start studying without stress. You should note that not all applications are approved. Furthermore, if approved, you must be prepared to start repaying the loan after one year of completing your studies.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is intended for general informational purposes only and does not address individual circumstances.
