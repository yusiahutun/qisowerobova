She wore gold hoop earrings that complimented her blonde tresses that were curled and flowed around her shoulders, while her makeup was subtly glam.</p><p>She was pictured alongside <a href=#>royals</a> such as Eugenie, her sister, Princess Beatrice, and their cousin, Zara Tindall. Both princesses matched in black dresses and, similar to Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, they let their hair loose. Zara also wore black that featured golden embroidery and puffed-out sleeves. Her blonde locks were up in a low bun which allowed for her silver earrings to show. She also accessorized with a golden watch.</p><p>The charity, which is named The Anti Slavery Collective was founded by Euginie and her friend Julia de Boinville. It aims to raise awareness of modern slavery and encourages authoritative bodies, journalists, government bodies, survivors, and others to make a difference and help put an end to human trafficking.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Prince Harry’s cousins were ‘very affected’ by his aunt Sarah Ferguson’s cancer diagnosis</a></strong></p><p>During an impactful speech at the event, Eugenie said: There are more enslaved men, women, and children than at any other time in history and it’s something that deeply affects us, and we knew from the start we wanted to make a difference. A lasting impact.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-s-words-about-cressida>Harry’s words about Cressida</h2><p>In his memoir Spare, Prince Harry wrote about his ex-girlfriend with loving words and told of how she helped him “across that barrier” as she helped him process <a href=#>Princess Diana’s</a> death and said that he cried over it for the first time since her burial.</p><p>“We’d gone back to my cousin’s chalet, where we were staying, and Cress was washing her face, brushing her teeth, while I was sitting on the edge of the bath. We were talking about nothing special, as I recall, but suddenly she asked about my mother.</p><p>“Unique. A girlfriend asking about my mother. But it was also the way she asked. Her tone was just the right blend of curiosity and compassion. The way she reacted to my answer was just right too. Surprised, concerned and with no judgement.”</p><p>The royal said that he was “indebted” to her. “She was the first person to help me across that barrier, to help me unleash the tears. It was cathartic, it accelerated our bond and added an element rare in past relationships: immense gratitude. I was indebted to Cress.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-talks-about-their-breakup>Harry talks about their breakup</h2><p>Also in his book, the 39-year-old spoke about their separation, which occurred two years before he met his now-wife <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>, and how it affected him. They broke up whilst on a skiing trip and Prince Harry said that breaking up with his ex-girlfriend made Cressida cry.</p><p>“I just knew. Cress, I think, knew as well. There was massive affection, deep and abiding loyalty – but not love everlasting. She was always clear about not wanting to take on the stresses of being a royal, and I was never sure I wanted to ask her to do so, and this unalterable fact, though it had been lurking in the background for some time, became undeniable on those Kazakh slopes. Suddenly it was clear. This can’t work.”</p><p>He said that after he consulted a friend about his feelings, he drove “straight” to see his ex.</p><p>“I drove straight over to see Cress. She was staying with a friend. Her bedroom was on the ground floor, windows looking onto the street. I heard cars and people going by as I sat gingerly on the bed and told her my thinking.</p><p>“She nodded. None of it seemed to surprise her. These things had been on her mind as well. ‘I’ve learned so much from you, Cress’. She nodded. She looked at the floor, tears running down her cheeks. Damn, I thought. She helped me cry. And now I’m leaving her in tears.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince Harry can’t back down in embarrassing ‘U-turn for his children’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2h9cLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2KxkrJ2inry2v4yer2afmae5p77InqWdZZSWx7u4xKxkqKZdp7KlecKaqamdpGKutHnSoZxmq6WlvbC%2B06xkq6eplrm0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-harrys-serious-ex-girlfriend-dazzles-on-red-carpet-as-she-supports-royals.html&text=Prince%20Harry%27s%20serious%20ex-girlfriend%20dazzles%20on%20Red%20Carpet%20as%20she%20supports%20royals&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harrys-serious-ex-girlfriend-dazzles-on-red-carpet-as-she-supports-royals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harrys-serious-ex-girlfriend-dazzles-on-red-carpet-as-she-supports-royals.html&title=Prince%20Harry%27s%20serious%20ex-girlfriend%20dazzles%20on%20Red%20Carpet%20as%20she%20supports%20royals" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-harrys-serious-ex-girlfriend-dazzles-on-red-carpet-as-she-supports-royals.html&title=Prince%20Harry%27s%20serious%20ex-girlfriend%20dazzles%20on%20Red%20Carpet%20as%20she%20supports%20royals" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harrys-serious-ex-girlfriend-dazzles-on-red-carpet-as-she-supports-royals.html&title=Prince%20Harry%27s%20serious%20ex-girlfriend%20dazzles%20on%20Red%20Carpet%20as%20she%20supports%20royals" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harrys-serious-ex-girlfriend-dazzles-on-red-carpet-as-she-supports-royals.html&description=Prince%20Harry%27s%20serious%20ex-girlfriend%20dazzles%20on%20Red%20Carpet%20as%20she%20supports%20royals" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kevin-clifton-reveals-surprising-connection-stacey-dooley-strictly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Strictly's Kevin Clifton opens up about surprising connection he had with partner Stacey Dooley">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./le-sserafim-announces-third-mini-album-easy-unveils-first-teaser-for-february-comeback-1273077.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LE SSERAFIM announces third mini-album EASY; unveils first teaser for February comeback">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
