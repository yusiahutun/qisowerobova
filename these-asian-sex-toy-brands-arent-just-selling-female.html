No.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That sort of silence has perpetuated a culture that perceives female pleasure as “shameful” and something that should be “hidden”, she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Take your sex life to another level with these experts’ tips</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Years of skewed opinions and medical research on women, due to a male-dominated world, have stifled true equality as well as real research into female sexuality,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Greening is referring to misconceptions that have plagued the field of women’s health – like the antiquated concept of “female hysteria”, a historical diagnosis for women exhibiting anything ranging from loss of interest in sex to, paradoxically, sexually forward behaviour, as well as the shroud that has long surrounded the female orgasm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For those reasons, We Are Fk doesn’t just sell adult products. The brand also runs an e-magazine that explores sex and all its extras, with articles ranging from newbie guides to vibrators to dealing with intimate body dysmorphia. (“Our girlie bits have been oppressed for centuries,” writes Greening in an article encouraging vulva-positivity in women, “but just look at all those glorious dongs on display in ancient statues.”)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/04/85082220-edc4-11ea-8288-5c49f42eee5c_972x_134432.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By educating and empowering women about their sexuality, Greening wants to create a “healthier environment” for women to understand themselves and their bodies – and, of course, have a few toe-curling orgasms along the way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though there remains woefully little scientific evidence that orgasms in themselves lead to specific health benefits, experts do agree on one thing: that the pleasure gained from said orgasms are in themselves beneficial, even if you have them alone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A literature review published in the Journal of Affective Disorders in 2011 looked at more than 100 scientific articles and studies on oxytocin – the mythical “love hormone” released during sex and while having an orgasm. It notes that the hormone “induces a general sense of well-being including calm”, and that its release is associated with secondary biochemical changes that “mediate long-term benefits”, such as reduced blood pressure. Other studies report that oxytocin can lessen anxiety and increase overall psychological stability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/04/88f248d4-edc4-11ea-8288-5c49f42eee5c_972x_134432.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But will a vibrator still bring as many benefits as a warm, fleshy partner? Experts say yes – to some extent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though having sex alone “won’t stimulate the release of as much oxytocin or other mood-boosting hormones”, self-pleasure still comes with a host of benefits that makes it well worth pursuing. That’s according to Dr Nicole Cirino, associate professor of psychiatry at the Oregon Health & Science University Centre for Women’s Health in the US.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/04/849f308a-edc4-11ea-8288-5c49f42eee5c_972x_134432.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clinical sexologist Dr Martha Tara Lee agrees. The Singapore-based therapist runs Eros Coaching, a counselling centre focused on sex – and how to do it better. She says that in recent years, more women have been coming forward with their bedroom-related issues – sometimes with their begrudging partners in tow.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Women are less likely to be willing to suffer in silence now,” Lee says. “I’ve had my fair share of clients throw themselves onto my couch with a puff, declare that they didn’t want to come, that they resent seeing me, and are only there because their partner – usually female – insisted on it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having the confidence to admit that something isn’t working in the bedroom is both empowering and beneficial, she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/04/835ab898-edc4-11ea-8288-5c49f42eee5c_972x_134432.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Having a healthy relationship with one’s sexuality is connected to our self-esteem and happiness,” Lee says. “When people take control of their sexuality, they learn how to have the lives that they want and deserve.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not only the women who are tired of archaic mindsets regarding their sexuality. Even men say they want to see change: just like Mattias Hulting and Peder Wikstrom, who created the Singapore-based adult toy brand Smile Makers back in 2013.</p>But you won’t find their aesthetic range of vibrators in a squalid sex shop. Stockists for the brand include <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Asian health and beauty chain Watsons</span></a>, Japanese department store chain Isetan and even US luxury department chain Saks Fifth Avenue. Getting its products placed in regular department stores is all part of Smile Makers’ push to normalise the discussion of women’s sexual health and their use of sex toys.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/04/86ae6314-edc4-11ea-8288-5c49f42eee5c_972x_134432.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite being founded by two men, Smile Makers’ range of products was conceived with plenty of female input – including from the two founders’ mothers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If your aim is to remove taboos and normalise something related to sex, being comfortable showing it to your mother is really the best acid test we know,” Hulting laughs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The idea for Smile Makers came when my co-founder Peder walked into a sex shop years ago to buy a vibrator for his girlfriend,” he adds. “But many of the brands in the shop were targeting male shoppers to use these products on women, rather than women buying something for themselves. The designs were vulgar, the communication very crass – even as a man, Peder was horrified.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/04/8554a456-edc4-11ea-8288-5c49f42eee5c_972x_134432.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such skewed perceptions can lead to sexual dysfunction, Hulting says, which in turn can lead to a “wide range of issues”. “It can make us insecure, thinking that something is wrong with us, and prevent us from having functioning relationships,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s why Smile Makers started their Vulva Talks education programme, which Hulting describes as “sex ed 2.0”. The workshops – which are supported by organisations such as UN Women and Singapore’s National University Hospital – delve into topics like pleasure equality, body awareness and inclusivity.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How much sex is normal?

We Are Fk co-founder Greening cites the increase in public activism – like the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">#MeToo movement</span></a> – and social media for the rapidly changing attitudes toward women’s sexuality.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For years, oppression has stifled female pride and sexual expression,” she says. “I think we’re tired of it.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Buried pleasuresWhy women’s sex is in better shape</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxoaWhiZoRwwMeeqp5lkai2orqMrJyxZaSkxm6u0Zqlnatdlr%2BmutNmoa6rpGLAprjLoqWgZZaauqK4xA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthese-asian-sex-toy-brands-arent-just-selling-female.html&text=These%20Asian%20sex%20toy%20brands%20arent%20just%20selling%20female-friendly%20vibrators%2c%20theyre%20helping%20women%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthese-asian-sex-toy-brands-arent-just-selling-female.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthese-asian-sex-toy-brands-arent-just-selling-female.html&title=These%20Asian%20sex%20toy%20brands%20arent%20just%20selling%20female-friendly%20vibrators%2c%20theyre%20helping%20women%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthese-asian-sex-toy-brands-arent-just-selling-female.html&title=These%20Asian%20sex%20toy%20brands%20arent%20just%20selling%20female-friendly%20vibrators%2c%20theyre%20helping%20women%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthese-asian-sex-toy-brands-arent-just-selling-female.html&title=These%20Asian%20sex%20toy%20brands%20arent%20just%20selling%20female-friendly%20vibrators%2c%20theyre%20helping%20women%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthese-asian-sex-toy-brands-arent-just-selling-female.html&description=These%20Asian%20sex%20toy%20brands%20arent%20just%20selling%20female-friendly%20vibrators%2c%20theyre%20helping%20women%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tory-lanezs-brother-speaks-rapper-gets-10-year-prison-sentence-megan-thee-stallion-shooting-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tory Lanez's brother speaks out after rapper gets 10 year prison sentence for Megan Thee Stallion sh">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ryan-goslings-older-sister-mandi-academy-awards-mother-stepfather-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan Gosling's older sister Mandi is effortlessly elegant in golden gown as she joins her brother at">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
