To boot, most <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>medical research</a> is still <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>conducted on male subjects</a>, leaving women out of the equation. "The majority of traditional drug development and research is not done with the female body in mind," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Stacia Woodcock, PharmD</a>, clinical pharmacist and dispensary manager at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6>Curaleaf</a>. "An even greater disparity comes with the development of prescription medications for female-focused needs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prime example? Men have over 10 erectile dysfunction meds on the market, and they can pop those pills whenever they need. Women, on the other hand, have two (pretty crappy) choices; "A pill that must be taken daily, and an intramuscular injection — neither lend themselves to real-life application in a positive way," says Woodcock. This is where cannabis comes in, she says. "The lack of focus on women's health, in general, has opened up a massive amount of interest in cannabis and how it can change that dynamic by targeting its use for specific women's health conditions."</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Stacia Woodcock, clinical pharmacist and dispensary manager at Curaleaf</h3><p>There is definitely more interest in the euphoric effect of THC and its potential to increase sexual pleasure and the intensity of orgasms for women</p><p>— Stacia Woodcock, clinical pharmacist and dispensary manager at Curaleaf</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The anecdotal evidence on weed translating to arousal varies, reports Woodcock, with women's stories encompassing anything from clinical applications (like countering vulvodynia pain) to the more playful (simply using weed to get more turned on). "There is definitely more interest in the euphoric effect of THC and its potential to increase sexual pleasure and the intensity of orgasms for women," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And it's not all talk. "Recent studies support anecdotal evidence that cannabis may improve a woman's libido," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elizabeth Ardillo, PharmD</a>, Director of Medical Education at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Green Thumb Industries</a>, who pointed to the work of two (female!) researchers in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Journal of Sexual Medicine</a>. "Many participants in [this] study found that cannabis helped them relax, heightened their sensitivity to touch, and increased intensity of feelings, thus enhancing their sexual experience," the study states. (FWIW, this particular survey was conducted on both men and women.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Felice Gersh, M.D</a>. ob-gyn, founder and director of the Integrative Medical Group of Irvine and author of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Menopause: 50 Things You Need to Know</a> echoes this. "There are many studies showing a small amount of [cannabis is] associated with an enhanced sexual response," she says. Yet, because of legal limitations (federal red tape), we still don't have a ton of research to go off of. (That said, we do have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>literal millenia of use</a> in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>cross-cultural practices</a> … as far back as 10,000 BC in Japan and 2,000 BC in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Ayurvedic</a> medicine.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although there are very few studies, relatively speaking, about the connection between cannabis use and women's sexual wellness (only 190 on PubMed published between 1970 and 2019 — there are nearly 9,000 about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>erectile dysfunction</a>), researchers have found enough good stuff to keep digging, says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Dasheeda Dawson</a>, molecular biologist & Chief Strategist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Cannabis Health Equity Movement</a> (CHEM).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Certainly, there is enough [data] for more and more women to try using cannabis as part of a libido-enhancing wellness regimen," she says, pointing to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a review of those 190 studies and articles</a> that corroborates the prolonged-and-improved-orgasms claim. Ardillo points to similar findings in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>2019 study on cannabis improving female orgasms</a>, and one on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>the positive association between 'marijuana use and sexual frequency'</a> (translation: weed made people want to get it on more often).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We're seeing a powerful movement; women are increasingly comfortable discussing their personal experiences with cannabis, which will benefit us all," says Ardillo. (If you've been one of those women, give yourself a pat on the back — you've done us all a great service).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Gersh notes that these results come from "very small amounts of cannabis," while, conversely, they're "dramatically reduced with large quantities of use," (we'll get to that shortly). She also points out that because still a lot we don't know, to remember that cannabis is a natural drug, and as with anything — from gluten to caffeine to pharmaceuticals — there can be risks. That being said, if you're only using it occasionally, the worst that could happen is probably a 'bad high.'</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wait-so-how-exactly-is-weed-an-aphrodisiac></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wait, So How Exactly Is Weed an Aphrodisiac?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Without getting too in the weeds (no pun intended), it's important to know that your body has a system that takes cannabis compounds and uses them to make you horny… amongst many other things.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The endocannabinoid system (ECS) enables cannabis to affect neurotransmitters and hormones, which both "play a large role in sexual desire and response," says Dr. Gersh. Once you inhale or eat your libido-booster, plant compounds (like THC) interact with the ECS, which then impacts hormones like estrogen and progesterone. Cannabinoid receptors (cells that can receive those weed compounds), are widespread in the female body and are found in the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, vagina, and vulva, explains Dawson. In other words, your vagina is very much 'open to receiving' some cannabis. "The current hypothesis is that cannabis plays a significant role in reproduction, in addition to controlling libido, and the pain and pleasure associated with the reproductive tract," Dawson says. She also points out that increased blood flow to those areas may play a role.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's not just chemical, though.Just like your inner workings, cannabis is intricate, complex, and multilayered. This isn't like popping a pill (like, say, Viagra) that does one specific job and then gets metabolized out. "Female sexuality is complex and involves the interplay between hormones, neurotransmitters, psychological, social, and environmental factors," says Dr. Gersh. Basically, a lot of things factor into libido, and "cannabis can have varying impacts on the female body and any or all of these factors," she says. So, it can be hard to pinpoint exactly where and how cannabis is working to rev your libido. Is it helping you chill out? Amping up a specific sex hormone? Reducing pain? Who can say! (This is what researchers want to find out.)</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>says Elizabeth Ardillo, PharmD, Director of Medical Education at Green Thumb Industries</h3><p>Cannabis has the potential to alleviate anxiety and stress, which often has a detrimental impact on arousal and intimacy</p><p>— says Elizabeth Ardillo, PharmD, Director of Medical Education at Green Thumb Industries</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And of course, there are the psychological benefits. "Cannabis has the potential to alleviate anxiety and stress, which often has a detrimental impact on arousal and intimacy," says Ardillo, adding that this is why many people feel more relaxed and present when using the right cannabis products. And as with alcohol, Dr. Gersh posits that "reduced inhibitions" may factor in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It also just helps you physically feel good — the body high is real. "Cannabis consumption can lead to a heightened sense of touch," says Ardillo. This is where those intense orgasms come in!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-does-strain-matter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Does Strain Matter?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Common questions that come up in research and conversation alike: What part of cannabis is producing these effects? Is it the whole plant together, or a particular compound (like THC or CBD)? Does strain matter?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let's address strains. Is there one that works best for sexuality and libido? As far as the data goes, probably not (but TBD, of course). "Varieties are a debated topic," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Clarenda Stanley, M.Ed</a>, CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Green Heffa Farms</a>, the first Black-owned farm to earn Certified B-Corporation status in the US. "Certain [strains] have certain effects on sexual desire and health, but for us, we look at the plants [and their effects] from a more holistic standpoint. When you feel good, that's going to impact every facet of your wellbeing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for compounds, Stanley suggests using all of it — the whole flower — positing that western culture puts a heavy emphasis on dissecting the plant into components, as well as compartmentalizing the body. "We make everything a commodity in this country, we dissect nature so much; we don't need to reverse engineer it!" she says. "With the whole flower, you get the entourage working together with your ECS; it's going to put you in a position of being more receptive to intimacy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stanley likes to complement the cannabis Sativa flower in her libido-boosting herbal blends, finding other medicinal plants, like damiana, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>used for centuries as an aphrodisiac</a>, that "play very well with it". (She also makes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>sTEAms</a> with cannabis that are legally sold as a beauty product, but as she notes on her website, if they happen to fall into your mug, "that is not our business.")</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, cannabis as a whole plant is still federally illegal. So can CBD — the federally legal plant compound from cannabis — do all this on its own? Hard maybe. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Inesa Ponomariovaite</a>, CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Nesas Hemp</a> says that "While there is no official data on CBD and hemp extract," we're relying largely on anecdotal evidence yet again. "I have my own [positive] data, and personal testimony on cannabinoids' effects on pleasure from thousands of people," she says. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>More on this topic here</a>!)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-you-enjoy-it-is-up-to-you--but-dosage-is-important></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How You Enjoy It is Up to You — But Dosage Is Important</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the best way to consume it (edibles, topicals, and vapes, oh my!), this is massively debated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Although still a viable option, most women exploring cannabis for sexual wellness and libido aren't just smoking joints and blunts to get 'in the mood,'" says Dawson. "I'm sure that's the image that comes to mind, and there's value in those experiences as means to reduce anxiety and increase relaxation, among many other benefits. However, many women aren't smoking anything at all but rather applying infused topical products or suppositories directly into the vagina." Dawson points to lubricants like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Foria</a>, which she says can "enhance the climax experience without making [you] feel 'high.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, your experience and the effects of cannabis will vary depending on how you're consuming it, says Ardillo. "Smoking or vaporizing marijuana has a faster onset time and those products can be used just a few minutes before an intimate setting," she explains. On the other hand, if you're consuming it — say, with an edible — you'll usually feel the full effect in two to four hours, depending on your metabolism.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the end though, as with most things, it comes down to preference. Whether you prefer a gummy, tincture, topical, or joint, "each of these products is available in different ratios of THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids, which means the effects can be customized to each individual's needs," Woodcock says. "In a world where women's health is often overlooked, this customization is both exciting and revolutionary."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One thing is for sure though: a little goes a long way. "A high dose [of cannabis leads] to reducing sexual interest and responsiveness," says Dr. Gersh. In other words, if you've ever smoked or eaten an edible and had the exact opposite effect, it wasn't a fluke. Dosage matters!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Multiple surveys across several decades have shown that women have similar results to some of the pre-clinical, rodent tests, says Dr. Gersh (it would appear that rats and humans are on a similar weed journey, here). "In females, sexual excitement, desire, orgasmic response, and overall sexual satisfaction was higher in women using small amounts of cannabis — with a blunting of these effects when high amounts were used." For this reason, Ardillo recommends looking for products that have a healthy balance of THC and CBD so you're not just getting THC which can often result in a 17/10 high — especially if you're new to it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-weed-for-overall-health--a-better-sex-life></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Weed For Overall Health = A Better Sex Life</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Being in a good mental and emotional space allows you to be in a better space when it comes to physical intimacy because with anxiety and an overall feeling of worry or angst, you're not going to be fully engaged with anything regarding intimacy," says Stanley. Instead of "looking at cannabis as a magic pill or magic bullet," she says, use it as a way to improve your mental and emotional health so you can tap into your own sexuality and intimacy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Woodcock agrees that cannabis provides an excellent 360 approach. "Because so many of these symptoms overlap, cannabis can be a great option for women; the domino effect allows women to treat their symptoms holistically, which in turn supports their sexual wellness needs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, like all things with sex (and the female body), this is not a cut-and-dry subject. "It's important to note that all cannabis experiences will depend on the individual consumer, their history, and comfort level," says Ardillo. In other words, the effect is dependent on the user (your own unique makeup and your system's sensitivity!), so if you have experience with cannabis and it didn't jive with your system (ie, you get paranoid or have negative side effects) — you do you. Don't force it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you do want to give it a go, Ardillo offers some advice. First: your mindset matters! "I like to encourage a positive 'set,' or mindset, and a pleasant and relaxed 'setting' while consuming," she says. Especially for sex!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And of course: "It's best to first become comfortable with the effects of these products before incorporating them into an intimate setting." Consider that permission to begin your own little sexual wellness experiment. Pop a gummy, crack open a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CANN</a>, or grab your rolling papers, and prepare for the imminent flying sparks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">*The word 'marijuana' is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>rife</a> with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>racist</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>anti-Mexican roots</a>, so we use the term cannabis — and sometimes weed! — throughout.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8KapaeZkp7Abr%2FEsQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcannabis-sex.html&text=Actually%2c%20Weed%20Can%20Be%20Great%20for%20Your%20Libido&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcannabis-sex.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcannabis-sex.html&title=Actually%2c%20Weed%20Can%20Be%20Great%20for%20Your%20Libido" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcannabis-sex.html&title=Actually%2c%20Weed%20Can%20Be%20Great%20for%20Your%20Libido" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcannabis-sex.html&title=Actually%2c%20Weed%20Can%20Be%20Great%20for%20Your%20Libido" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcannabis-sex.html&description=Actually%2c%20Weed%20Can%20Be%20Great%20for%20Your%20Libido" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./danny-pudi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Pudi - Bio, Age, Career, Height, Net Worth, Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./joanna-gaines-hospitalized-fixer-upper-star-health-update.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Was Joanna Gaines Hospitalized?
