The sweet lyrics are seemingly inspired by his own personal life, even though the then-aspiring artist was really just18 when he first met Heather in 1995. He was singing at Rio Palm Isle in Longview, Texas—which just so happened to be her father's club. But college and Joe's music put their relationship on hold, and it wasn't until September 9, 2007 that the two tied the knot, both at the age of 30.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">[facebook ]<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201490215291374&set=a.1483010209324.70534.1655927445&type=1&theater" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1020149021..." class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1020149021...</a> data-width="800"[/facebook]</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"The timing was always wrong, but in hindsight, it was probably right, because we weren't ready then," the bride told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/celebrity/countrys-joe-nichols-marries-longtime-sweetheart/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">People</a> prior to the wedding ceremony at Bethesda School for Boys in Savannah, Georgia. "Now is the right time. I'm so sure, I'm not even nervous." Joe, too, said he felt like "the happiest man in the world," calling Heather "the love of my life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">By then, Joe had No. 1 songs like "Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off," and "Brokenheartsville" under his belt—with more hits including "Gimme That Girl" on the way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="dropcap css-1ez97s8 et3p2gv0">Everything seemed pretty perfect at first. "It was so romantic," Heather said to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/archive/joe-nichols-ive-been-given-a-second-chance/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">People</a>. "Then came the shock." Just one month after their wedding, Joe checked into rehab for alcoholism. Heather reportedly had no idea about his drinking problem. "He put so much energy into hiding it," she said. "It was complete devastation. Besides being sad, I had a lot of anger, like, 'How could you have done this to me?'" Heather had serious doubts about Joe and their marriage, but her dad reminded her that Joe needed her now more than ever.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"We faced this ugly thing 30 days after our wedding. I felt like if we could get through that, that's a good sign."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-fkadry eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"[Joe] told me, 'In you, I see who I am,'" remembered Heather. "It really bonded us. We faced this ugly thing 30 days after our wedding. I felt like if we could get through that, that's a good sign."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The worst seemed to be behind them, but they had no idea the challenges they had yet to face. In a 2012 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.morethananicholsworth.com/about-heather/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="blog post" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">blog post</a>, Heather revealed that they had been struggling to have a baby, suffering five miscarriages in three years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"Growing up, out of all of my friends I was the one that didn't care about college or a high-powered job," she wrote. "All I ever wanted was children. My mother and my sisters all had babies so easily that it never crossed my mind that I would have any trouble."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Gradually, doctors began to understand more and more about why Heather kept miscarrying, including her body's "autoimmune response to pregnancy" and a thyroid condition. When Heather lost the fifth baby, she nearly lost hope as well.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"At this 9 week appointment, we saw a beautiful baby but no heartbeat. My husband and I were devastated. This was my lowest point I think because I was doing everything I could do. My stomach was black and blue from the heparin shots, my arms were sore from the constant bloodwork, but my heart was in the worse shape of all. If this news wasn't bad enough I had to do a D&C because the pregnancy like my first one had gone too far to pass naturally. After the surgery I felt robbed. My baby was gone along with my spirit."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Finally, in 2012, after undergoing IVF, IVIG, steroid therapy, and unimaginable emotional pain, the couple welcomed a healthy baby girl, whom they named Dylan River in honor of Heather's childhood friend who passed away.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"This is one of the most humbling and remarkable experiences," Joe told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2012/04/18/joe-nichols-welcomes-daughter-dylan-river/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">People</a>. "Heather is amazing, and I am just so thankful our little girl is here. She is truly a miracle."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Another miracle followed in 2014. Joe and Heather named their second daughter together Georgia Blue. Suddenly, Joe was surrounded by girls (he also has a daughter named Ashelyn, now 19, from a previous relationship).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"I enjoy all the pink everywhere, being Heather's husband and the daddy for the girls," he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2014/10/24/joe-nichols-family-man-daughter-georgia-photo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">People</a>. "I'll do anything to make them happy."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">After all they've been through, Joe told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://tasteofcountry.com/joe-nichols-backstory-alcoholism-abuse/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=GAC class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">GAC</a> shortly after Dylan was born, "There's no way Heather should still be married to me. There's no way. It's only by grace."</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/5b13ab23-04f6-4c1c-a43e-6ded9235e3be_1521574058.jpg alt="Headshot of Taysha Murtaugh" title="Headshot of Taysha Murtaugh" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Taysha Murtaugh was the Lifestyle Editor at CountryLiving.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6ipayomaeutbXOp5ilZaOpvLO1xKxmp52nqHyigJNrZ3FnmqSybrrInJ%2BopKNitaat06Gcq2WjnruouMStpqdlnKTDpnnSraarsV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoe-nichols-heather-singleton-love-story.html&text=How%20Joe%20%26amp%3b%20Heather%20Nichols%20Survived%205%20Devastating%20Miscarriagesand%20Came%20Out%20Stronger%20on%20the%20Other%20S&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-nichols-heather-singleton-love-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-nichols-heather-singleton-love-story.html&title=How%20Joe%20%26amp%3b%20Heather%20Nichols%20Survived%205%20Devastating%20Miscarriagesand%20Came%20Out%20Stronger%20on%20the%20Other%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoe-nichols-heather-singleton-love-story.html&title=How%20Joe%20%26amp%3b%20Heather%20Nichols%20Survived%205%20Devastating%20Miscarriagesand%20Came%20Out%20Stronger%20on%20the%20Other%20S" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-nichols-heather-singleton-love-story.html&title=How%20Joe%20%26amp%3b%20Heather%20Nichols%20Survived%205%20Devastating%20Miscarriagesand%20Came%20Out%20Stronger%20on%20the%20Other%20S" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-nichols-heather-singleton-love-story.html&description=How%20Joe%20%26amp%3b%20Heather%20Nichols%20Survived%205%20Devastating%20Miscarriagesand%20Came%20Out%20Stronger%20on%20the%20Other%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nichole-cable-mother-15-year-old-girl-slain-man-met-online-pleads-parents-vigilant-kids-use-social-media-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nichole Cable: Mother of 15-year-old girl 'slain by a man she met online' pleads with parents to be ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./broadway-hamilton-cast-to-reunite-and-perform-at-the-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Broadway's 'Hamilton' Cast To Appear With Pre-Recorded Performance at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Pa">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
