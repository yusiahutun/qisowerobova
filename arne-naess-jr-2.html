Arne rose to prominence in every industry in which he worked. He was born in Germany and spent the Second World War there with his parents. Arne later relocated to Norway with his mother after his parents divorced after the war. He had always wanted to climb mountains and began pursuing his goal in his adolescence. He documented his Norwegian mountain climbing adventures when he was 19 years old.</p><p>However, due to certain actual challenges, Arne was forced to transition from mountaineering to business. He was involved in trading in major cities throughout the world, including London. As a businessman, my personality began with shipping, real estate, and oil investing. In the 1960s and 1970s, Arne invested in a number of businesses. And it was all for the better. Meanwhile, the business magnate spent ample time with his family. Arne attempted to rekindle his interest in mountaineering after years in business.</p><p>He returned to the lap of mountains in the late 1970s to further investigate nature. The adventurer was in charge of organizing the first Norwegian expedition to Mount Everest. In his later years, Arne hoped to devote himself to mountaineering. In his thirst to stay connected with the mountains, he left his family and friends far behind. Arne was honored multiple times for his bravery on the slopes.
