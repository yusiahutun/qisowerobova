The Duchess herself said last month they are making their own traditions now they’re a tight family unit. But what does this mean for their relationship with The Firm across the Atlantic? If Harry does intend to ‘call Charles’ on the big day to send half-hearted well-wishes, it doesn’t exactly spark hope of the family coming together for the holidays.</strong></p><p>The festive period, for those who celebrate it, is a time for family. This is a loose term, as people around the world have their own different types of families. Whether it’s divorced parents, caregivers or siblings, a family is made up of people who have been there for you. No family has managed to avoid some sort of drama. It doesn’t matter if it’s crafted from long-term friends with no blood relatives.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>But what makes this time extra special, is being able to push any grievances aside to see the bigger picture. Now, that may not be on the top of <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry’s Christmas list, by the looks of it. Last month, the 42-year-old, who <a href=#>enjoyed the dazzling Red Carpet</a>, told cameras she and the Duke are now looking forward to making their own traditions. This was labeled as a hint the Sussexes won’t be jet-setting back to the UK to see <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s family in Windsor. The couple could pin it on saving the planet with one less plane journey. But considering they are a lover of private jets, I’m not sure whether that’ll spin well with fans.</p><p>After analysis of Meghan and Harry’s Christmas card screaming signs they’re focusing on their brand instead of emotional outpourings of personal updates, it’s hard to see if Harry’s call to Charles will be enough to keep the <a href=#>royal</a> ties together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-s-ties-with-the-firm-are-clinging-on-for-dear-life>‘Meghan and Harry’s ties with The Firm are clinging on for dear life’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1086841420-1024x650.jpg><p>It’s been quite a turbulent year for those caught up in the Sussex narrative. We all remember by now the 38-year-old prince’s remarkable autobiography, which hit the shelves in January. Fans were still hyped by the pair airing the <a href=#>royal family’s dirty laundry</a>. It even sold more than Barack Obama’s memoir. That’s quite a big feat, even for a ‘Spare’ heir.</p><p>It seemed the royal drama was over, but we were wrong. When King Charles’ birthday came round this fall, more ensued. Reports came out to claim the <a href=#>Duke and Duchess of Sussex snubbed the monarch’s invite</a> to join in the celebrations. But an official spokesperson for Meghan and Harry jumped at the chance to set the record straight. They told newspapers the couple didn’t even receive an invitation – swinging the ball back into the palace’s court at 100kmh.</p><p>If you were hoping to avoid any arguments with your family, would you be quick to score low points? The couple don’t often respond to the vast amount of rumors and speculation out there on the web, so why did this matter?</p><p>Apparently, it did. A lot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-and-meghan-christmas-plans-come-after-a-year-of-royal-drama>Harry and Meghan Christmas plans come after a year of royal drama</h2><p>At the beginning of the dad-of-two’s memoir Spare, Harry sets the scene of him calling a grave and urgent meeting with his dad and brother, <a href=#>Prince William</a>. It was after Prince Philip’s funeral, their grandfather and Prince Consort to the now late <a href=#>Queen</a>. Harry knew that because it came after his and Meghan’s tell-all chat with <a href=#>celebrity</a> pal Oprah Winfrey, there may be some tensions if he saw his family face-to-face. But, wanting to get the ball rolling in repairing the famous royal feud – which apparently began over <a href=#>William’s warning about Meghan</a> – he made the first move.</p><p>Asking for an <a href=#>apology from Wills and Charles</a> for how the pair were treated didn’t exactly go down well. It didn’t go down at all. Harry claimed his brother and father knew absolutely no reason why the couple were upset. So, what does he do? He writes a 410-page book detailing every minor detail from his childhood and royal life for the world to lap up.</p><p>Then <a href=#>Omid Scobie’s controversial book Endgame</a> made its debut in November – before it was pulled from the shelves over a ‘translating printing error’. This didn’t help the situation at all, considering the couple worked with the authors of Finding Freedom years before, an unofficial biography of the pair leaving The Firm.</p><p>At the time, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex denied any involvement with the information found within its pages. However, emails released into court as evidence from their former staff, Jason Knauf, told a different story. During Meghan’s court case against the Mail Online (Associated Newspapers) over a private letter she wrote her father being published in the paper, the former TV star apologized, claiming not to have misled the court. The couple, through their personal assistant, did work with the royal authors. But she made it clear that neither of the couples actually sat down with the writers themselves, therefore, despite telling Knauf what to tell them, had no idea what was going to be printed.</p><p>Struggling to keep up? We are too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-don-t-explain-don-t-complain-and-apparently-don-t-say-anything>‘Don’t explain, don’t complain’ and apparently don’t say anything</h2><p>The royals have not come forward to either denounce or support the new bombshell book. It targets senior members of The Firm – even <a href=#>Kate Middleton isn’t off limits</a>.</p><p>The palace sticks to the royal tradition of ‘don’t explain, don’t complain’ when it comes to idle gossip and headlines, but Hazzer himself has admitted he doesn’t want to follow that.</p><p>So why the Sussexes are keeping quiet now is as mind-baffling as the Duke writing about his frostbitten penis for millions to read.</p><p>This could also be a blow to the ongoing rift within the palace. Silence is as telling as having something to say.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-and-meghan-christmas-call-to-charles-is-suspicious>Harry and Meghan Christmas call to Charles is ‘suspicious’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-961417540-1024x792.jpg><p>Royal expert Kinsey Schofield told GB News Meghan’s team “doesn’t appear to know what to do at this point. The consensus is that they need to repair the damage within the royal family.”</p><p>She highlighted reports claiming brands don’t want to work the Sussexes, as they struggle to find their feet since 2020. A PR expert last year also gave their two cents. They alleged the <a href=#>brand of Sussex is ‘toxic’</a>, advising the parents to work on separating for work events to bury it under the carpet.</p><p>Kinsey believed it was “suspicious” <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a> of Harry calling his father to clear the air came after those stories. A positive spin on a negative press story.</p><p>Whereas, The Telegraph is writing how sources allege Harry and Meghan are “highly unlikely” to turn down an invitation this Christmas at Sandringham. They say it could be the recent ripples from Endgame at play.</p><p>But if we take a look at the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Harry and Meghan’s Christmas card</a> this year, it could be more telling of their ongoing narrative. Instead of the family-orientated card they produce every year, following other royals, they chose business. <a href=#>Archie and Lilibet</a> didn’t make an appearance either. This is something royal fans do miss as the little ones are kept out of updates from the Sussexes. A photo of the pair at the Invictus Games, a cause close to Harry’s heart, was chosen. Could this be setting the tone of what’s to come? The duo focusing on their professional lives and charity foundation?</p><p>I can imagine the small talk at the Christmas dinner between Harry, Meghan, Kate and William being as cold as the British December morning. It may be best avoided. Perhaps ditching the formalities is actually a win for the Sussexes. What better way to prevent more drama than not showing up? At all?</p><p>Stick to FaceTime instead.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eBcLvPoqWip55iuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsYyapZ1loKe2r6%2FEZp%2BaqqKuwG6vx6ugrKydlsBurdaasGaeoqS6bsDHnmSrp6mWubR50qmcmqOjYsOwuNSmnKxn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fopinion-meghan-markle-and-prince-harrys-christmas-away-from-the-royals-speaks-volumes.html&text=Opinion%3a%20Meghan%20Markle%20and%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20Christmas%20away%20from%20the%20royals%20speaks%20volumes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fopinion-meghan-markle-and-prince-harrys-christmas-away-from-the-royals-speaks-volumes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fopinion-meghan-markle-and-prince-harrys-christmas-away-from-the-royals-speaks-volumes.html&title=Opinion%3a%20Meghan%20Markle%20and%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20Christmas%20away%20from%20the%20royals%20speaks%20volumes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fopinion-meghan-markle-and-prince-harrys-christmas-away-from-the-royals-speaks-volumes.html&title=Opinion%3a%20Meghan%20Markle%20and%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20Christmas%20away%20from%20the%20royals%20speaks%20volumes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fopinion-meghan-markle-and-prince-harrys-christmas-away-from-the-royals-speaks-volumes.html&title=Opinion%3a%20Meghan%20Markle%20and%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20Christmas%20away%20from%20the%20royals%20speaks%20volumes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fopinion-meghan-markle-and-prince-harrys-christmas-away-from-the-royals-speaks-volumes.html&description=Opinion%3a%20Meghan%20Markle%20and%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20Christmas%20away%20from%20the%20royals%20speaks%20volumes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-caption-ideas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="100 Best Taylor Swift Themed Instagram Caption Ideas about Love, Life, and Friendship">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meaning-of-bellyache-by-billie-eilish-3.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meaning of Bellyache by Billie Eilish">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
