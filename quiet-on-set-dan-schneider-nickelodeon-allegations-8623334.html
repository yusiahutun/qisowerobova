The series, which has been watched by more than 16 million viewers and set streaming records on Max, explores allegations of "discriminatory behavior" against Dan Schneider — the creator behind beloved series like&nbsp;The Amanda Show,&nbsp;Zoey 101,&nbsp;Drake & Josh,&nbsp;iCarly, and&nbsp;Victorious —&nbsp;plus allegations of abuse against former dialogue coach Brian Peck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Quiet on Set opens with a disclaimer: "I will warn you, if you were a child of the ’90s, this is going to ruin that for you." In response to the series, Nickelodeon subsequently&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>released a statement</a>&nbsp;saying that it “investigates all formal complaints” and has “adopted numerous safeguards over the years," but added that it "cannot corroborate or negate allegations of behaviors from productions decades ago."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Initially, the four-episode series set out to detail everything that went on behind the scenes at Nickelodeon under Schneider's tenure, but an additional episode is set to air on Apr. 7 after critics and fans reacted to the initial reports of abuse and harassment towards child stars. Here's everything you need to know before the new episode airs on Max.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-is-dan-schneider-and-what-are-the-allegations-against-him></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who is Dan Schneider and what are the allegations against him?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once described as Nickelodeon's "golden boy," Dan Schneider created a number of the most successful live-action shows in Nickelodeon history. Sources close to the network say that his success "enabled his bad behavior."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His career at the kids' network began in the 1990s, when he worked as a writer and producer. Eventually, he would go on to create&nbsp;The Amanda Show,&nbsp;Zoey 101,&nbsp;Drake & Josh, and&nbsp;iCarly.&nbsp;He&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"parted ways" with Nickelodeon in 2018</a>&nbsp;after he was accused of creating a hostile work environment. In a gender discrimination and hostile workplace claim that was filed in 2000, a writer on&nbsp;The Amanda Show&nbsp;claimed that Schneider had made her uncomfortable by persistently requesting massages.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When&nbsp;iCarly&nbsp;star Jennette McCurdy published her memoir,&nbsp;I'm Glad My Mom Died, many readers speculated that she was calling out Schnider when she wrote about an executive that "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>pressured her into drinking alcohol</a>, gave her an unwanted massage, and pitted young actors against one another," according to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Business Insider</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, McCurdy and her&nbsp;Sam & Cat&nbsp;co-star Ariana Grande filed complaints about a producer on their show. Insider reports that an investigation launched in 2013 found inappropriate behavior on the set of the&nbsp;iCarly&nbsp;spinoff. Schneider had reportedly contributed to the “toxicity” on set and McCurdy wrote that “the Creator” was “no longer allowed to be on set with any actors.” Later in 2017 and 2018, Nickelodeon’s parent company, Viacom CBS, launched another investigation into Schneider’s “alleged sexual behavior." Even though it found&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>no evidence of sexual misconduct</a>, the report stated that Schneider could be verbally abusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Russell Hicks, Nickelodeon’s former president of content and production, told the publication that a standards-and-practices group read every script for Schneider’s shows. Additionally, programming executives watched every episode and parents and caregivers were always on set. “Every single thing that Dan ever did on any of his shows was carefully scrutinized and approved,” Hicks wrote in a statement shared by Insider.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2021 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The&nbsp;New York Times</a>, Schneider claimed that he was never inappropriate with staff. "I couldn't, and I wouldn't have the long-term friendships and continued loyalty from so many reputable people if I'd mistreated my actors of any age, especially minors," Schneider said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, female writers claimed that Schneider "openly stated he didn't like having female writers in the writers' room" although many of his shows featured female leads. None of Schneider's shows ever credited more than two female writers, Insider notes, with&nbsp;Zoey 101&nbsp;and&nbsp;Drake & Josh&nbsp;having no female writers during their runs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kayla Alpert told the outlet that Schneider said that women were not funny and asked her to name a funny woman. "It speaks to something very dark and very wrong," Alpert said. Jenny Kilgen, who worked on&nbsp;The Amanda Show, accused the show's production company of gender discrimination and creating a hostile work environment, though Schneider wasn't specifically named in the suit. The case was eventually settled out of court.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Ben A.

She also said that female actors would frequently sit on Schneider's lap on the&nbsp;Zoey 101&nbsp;set.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Virgil Fabian, the director of&nbsp;All That,&nbsp;and cast members Giovonnie Samuels, Kyle Sullivan, Bryan Hearne, and Katrina Johnson also appeared in the documentary. Hearne and Samuels shared that they&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>experienced racism on set</a>, alleging they were often cast in "stereotyped" roles and treated poorly by Schneider.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Drake & Josh&nbsp;star Drake Bell&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>spoke about being sexually assaulted</a>&nbsp;when he was 15 by dialogue coach Brian Peck. In 2004, Peck was sentenced to 16 months in prison after pleading "no contest" to a lewd act against a child and oral copulation with an unnamed Nickelodeon child actor; Bell&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>came forward</a>&nbsp;as the minor mentioned in the case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was sleeping on the couch where I usually sleep, and I woke up to him," Drake said in a clip from the documentary, according to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "I opened my eyes, and I woke up and he was … he was sexually assaulting me. And I froze and was in complete shock and had no idea what to do or how to react."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You know anytime I had an audition or anytime I needed to work on dialogue or anything, I somehow ended up back at Brian's house," Bell continued. "And it just got worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and I was just trapped. I had no way out. The abuse was extensive, and it got pretty brutal."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Mazur/WireImage</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-which-actors-have-spoken-out-since-quiet-on-set></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Which actors have spoken out since&nbsp;Quiet On Set?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Mar. 22, Bell's Drake & Josh co-star, Josh Peck,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;Quiet on Set, writing that it “took a few days to process it.” He explained in an Instagram post, “I reached out to Drake privately, but wanted to give my support for the survivors who were brave enough to share their stories of emotional and physical abuse on Nickelodeon sets with the world. Children should be protected. Reliving this publicly is incredibly difficult, but I hope it can bring healing for the victims and their families as well as necessary change to our industry.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nancy Sullivan, who played Drake’s mother on&nbsp;Drake & Josh, also publicly shared her support for Bell. “It broke my heart into a million pieces to hear just how much Drake was holding inside while we were working together,” she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a>&nbsp;in an Instagram post. “I was both devastated and proud seeing the man he’s grown into sit down on camera and bravely tell his truth.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ned’s Declassified School Survivor’s Guide&nbsp;stars Devon Werkheiser, Lindsey Shaw, and Daniel Curtis Lee ridiculed Bell's situation, but later apologized, saying that the trio hadn’t yet seen&nbsp;Quiet on Set&nbsp;when they made the “super shit” joke. Werkheiser&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote an apology on X</a>, which read, “Everyone was asking us for our opinions on it, and I get it. Now, having seen the documentary, it’s so disturbing. Now, we’ve watched it, and I get it. If I had just watched especially that third episode and then watched us joking like that … I would be like, ‘Are they sociopaths? Is something wrong with them?’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I hate that this happened,” Shaw added. “I hate that we compounded any trauma around this situation that means so much to each of us. I am sorry.” Zoey 101&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Alexa Nikolas</a>, who was also among the Nickelodeon stars that appeared in&nbsp;Quiet on Set,&nbsp;posted a YouTube series following the show's release.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m going to cut to the chase here: You don’t feel anything, Dan. You have no idea what accountability is," she said in one clip. "You’re searching for it, maybe, but you haven’t landed on it. That’s for sure. This is not the way."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Matthew Underwood, who starred as Logan on&nbsp;Zoey 101,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>released a statement on Instagram</a>&nbsp;that explained the traumatic experiences he had on set made him quit acting altogether. “I know many folks want me to respond to the&nbsp;Quiet on Set&nbsp;documentary," he wrote. "I’m going to share something with you that I never thought I’d have to talk about publicly, as it’s honestly none of your business anyway."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor shared he was groomed and molested at age 12 by his best friend’s stepfather and would go on to lose contact with his friends because he “couldn’t spend any time with them without feeling the personal disgust and betrayal brought on by a man I trusted as a father to me.” He was also "sexually harassed and then assaulted” at 19 by his agent at the time. Underwood noted that he reported his former agent and the man was fired, but remains “active in the industry."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Allie DiMeco, who starred in&nbsp;The Naked Brothers Band, posted a series of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TikTok videos</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>her own experiences</a>&nbsp;with Schneider and Nickelodeon after the release of the docuseries. She noted that she was “stressed” while watching&nbsp;Quiet on Set&nbsp;and also experienced trauma while working on the Nickelodeon series.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There was an episode where Rosalina ‘cheated’ on Nat and kind of kissed a French guy,” she said, noting that she did not want to kiss him. “He’s a 30-year-old man. I’m sorry, I couldn’t even watch it. It gives me fucking the ick, and it honestly gives me PTSD." She added that she felt pressured to comply even though she was uncomfortable because she feared that she'd lose her job if she spoke up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kenan Thompson addressed the documentary while&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>appearing on&nbsp;The Tamron Hall Show&nbsp;</a>on Mar. 27, voicing his support for survivors. He said that although he did not share the same experiences as some of the other stars, he supported their decision to speak out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Because all these things happened after I left, basically, and Dan [Schneider] wasn’t really on&nbsp;Kenan & Kel&nbsp;like that. I mean, he got a ‘created by’ credit, but it was a different showrunner. So, our worlds weren’t really overlapping outside of all that, necessarily. And then all that negativity kind of started happening outside of our tenure there,” Thompson said. "I think it’s a good thing that the doc is out, and it’s putting things on display that need to be, you know, stories that need to be told for this, accountability sake. But it’s definitely tough to watch because I have fond memories of that place, and I have fond memories of my co-stars and stuff like that. So, to hear that they’ve gone through terrible things like that, it’s just, it’s really tough.​​”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-was-nickelodeons-response-to-quiet-on-set></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What was Nickelodeon's response to&nbsp;Quiet On Set?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The network said it has taken action to investigate any allegations to create a "workplace environment free of harassment or other kinds of inappropriate conduct," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to a statement shared by NBC News.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a statement shared by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ABC News</a>, Nickelodeon stated that it "cannot corroborate or negate allegations of behaviors from productions decades ago, Nickelodeon as a matter of policy investigates all formal complaints as part of our commitment to fostering a safe and professional workplace environment free of harassment or other kinds of inappropriate conduct."

"In fact, nothing was designed for me to end up normal. Stable. Alive. Something I have learned is that as long as we are enchanted or complacent, we're also vulnerable.
