This propensity for betterment acts as a driving force for us to seek greater things constantly. Human betterment is an endless pursuit. Since the dawn of our existence, humans have been relentlessly exhibiting their desire to seek for more. Whether it may be materialistic or superficial possessions, knowledge, learning, exposure, a sense of belongingness, power, or experiences, we navigate through life by virtue of these innate needs that require fulfilment.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What is betterment?</h4><p>In its truest sense, betterment goes beyond chasing worldly possessions. It is the human desire for constant improvement. We seek to enrich our lives through a dynamic endeavor spread across various dimensions. Betterment or self-improvement encompasses various facets of human existence, including physical health, financial health, mental well-being, relationships, education, skills, knowledge, spirituality, ethics, social justice; environmental sustainability- the list is endless.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#><strong>What is Social Perception?</strong></a></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Why do humans seek betterment?</h4><p>As quoted by Cesar Pelli, “The desire to reach for the sky runs deep in our human psyche”. It is natural for humans to seek progress, both individually and inclusively. Self-betterment is one of the deepest-rooted desires of human nature. In today’s era where competition is tough, there are ample reasons that motivate a person to push himself or herself to become better and achieve greater heights.</p><p>Psychologists have been actively involved in studying and understanding the mechanisms that drive individuals to seek improvement, ranging from intrinsic motivation to external influences and societal expectations. The human psyche and the social system deeply root these motivations. The desire to be better than others can spring from factors like social comparison, competition, and the desire for fame or status. Conversely, seeking improvement with the goal of benefiting humanity reflects a more altruistic and collective mindset, focusing on contributing to the greater good.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs:</h5><p>Maslow’s need hierarchy theory of motivation suggests that the innate needs of an individual are what motivate or drive his behaviour throughout life. He categorized human needs in the following hierarchy: basic &lt; psychological &lt; self-fulfillment needs. Once people fulfill their deficiency needs (basic and psychological), they strive towards attaining growth needs (self-fulfillment), where they care less about what they have and more about who they are; and who they want to be. Our insatiable desire for more is rooted in evolution. Over generations, those with a strong desire for resources were more likely to survive. This survival-oriented trait, passed down through generations, deeply motivates individuals to consistently seek and acquire more.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#><strong>Awareness And Useful Solutions To Psychological Disorders</strong></a></p><p>As social beings, comparing ourselves to others comes natural to us. In a world where success and happiness are often associated with fame and materialism, our desire for more is influenced by this social context. The pressure to meet societal expectations fuels our constant pursuit to keep up or surpass others. Our ability to adapt quickly to positive changes, known as hedonic adaptation, contributes to our unending desire for more. As we become accustomed to positive shifts, we experience a decrease in satisfaction, which prompts us to seek new sources of stimulation and fulfillment.<br></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Modern Landscape of Desires:</h5><p>Our desires are shaped by the culture we live in. Consumerism, driven by advertising, tells us that material possessions equal happiness and success. Constant exposure to these messages ingrains the pursuit of more into our culture, intensifying our insatiable desire. Recent trends suggest that there is an increasing popularity of self- improvement books, courses, and apps. The complexities and stresses of modern life is a promoting factor for the self- improvement industry. These resources and tools offer guidance to people who are increasingly seeking ways to improve their mental and emotional well-being, cultivate meaningful relationships, and find a sense of purpose in their lives.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#><strong>The Craze of Self-Help Books in People</strong></a></p><p>Beyond external influences, humans have an innate desire for personal fulfillment and growth. This internal drive leads us to set goals and strive for improvement. While fulfilling, this quest also contributes to our constant desire for more, as achieving one goal often leads to the pursuit of the next. Positive psychology, a branch of psychology that emphasizes human strengths and well-being, significantly contributes to the psychology of human betterment. Contrary to the the traditional focus of addressing problems and illness, this branch of psychology aims to cultivate virtues, strengths, and positive emotions. By attending to these factors, individuals can not only overcome challenges but also enhance their overall life satisfaction and resilience.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Neurological Underpinnings of Motivation:</h5><p>Neuroscience suggests that the act of seeking itself, rather than achieving the end goal, is intrinsically motivating and leds to satisfaction. Neuroscientist Jack Panksepp highlighted the significance of seeking amongst the seven core instincts in human brain. <a href=#>Dopamine</a>, a neurotransmitter, present in the seeking systems of all mammals, is linked to reward and pleasure. We can describe the seeking system as a mechanism that drives our actions toward survival and fulfilling our desires. It is integral to our motivation, urge to explore and desire to understand. This helps explain certain phenomena, such as the fact that achieving major goals or winning a lottery may not necessarily cause long-term changes in happiness. However, the ever-going quest brings with it a sense of fulfillment and excitement, which can contribute, to a more adequate living.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#><strong>How to be your own Master?</strong></a></p><p><a href=#>Resilience</a>, Self-efficacy and Mindset of an individual can influence his journey towards betterment. Cultivating resilience, the ability to bounce back from adversity, strengthening self- efficacy, the belief in one’s ability to accomplish tasks and achieve goals, and developing a growth mindset, where challenges are viewed as opportunities for learning and improvement, are certain psychological strategies that can be employed by those devoted to bettering themselves. Inculcating mindfulness and therapeutic interventions can facilitate individuals in following their path to personal growth.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Harmony in Aspiration:</h5><p>While our pursuit for seeking more has doubtlessly nurtured progress and transformation, it is essential to strike a balance between wanting more and being content with what we have. Understanding that our desire for more is a consequence of evolutionary, psychological, and societal factors can help us gain a deeper understanding of our motivations.</p><p>Growth is a continuous journey. As humans evolve and encounter new challenges, the psychological understanding of human betterment adapts correspondingly, offering insights into the dynamic nature of the quest for self-improvement.</p>References+<ul><li>Neuroscience confirms that to be truly happy, you will always need something more (qz.com)</li><li>The Endless Pursuit: Unveiling the Roots of Humans’ Insatiable Desire for More | by David Priede, PhD | Medium</li></ul><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Motivation</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Appearance over Achievement?: UP Board Topper Trolled for</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Motivation</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychology of Entrepreneurship</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 4, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Motivation</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>6 Tips to Gain Motivation: Be Motivated Even</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>March 18, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Motivation</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Women for Women</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>March 12, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Motivation</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Women’s Day: Unrealistic Beauty Standards and Mental Health</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>March 6, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmraCVYr20xcKhpqWnl656sLKMoaymmZ5ir6bA056ppp2eqXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-psychology-of-human-betterment.html&text=The%20Psychology%20of%20Human%20Betterment&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-psychology-of-human-betterment.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-psychology-of-human-betterment.html&title=The%20Psychology%20of%20Human%20Betterment" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-psychology-of-human-betterment.html&title=The%20Psychology%20of%20Human%20Betterment" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-psychology-of-human-betterment.html&title=The%20Psychology%20of%20Human%20Betterment" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-psychology-of-human-betterment.html&description=The%20Psychology%20of%20Human%20Betterment" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-world-highest-cities-altitude.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where are the world's highest cities? | Cities">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./richard-geres-net-worth-the-pretty-woman-star-made-a-lot-of-money.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richard Gere's Net Worth: The 'Pretty Woman' Star Made a Lot of Money">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
