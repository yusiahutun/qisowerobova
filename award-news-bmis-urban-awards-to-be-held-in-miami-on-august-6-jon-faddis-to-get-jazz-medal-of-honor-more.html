Originally scheduled for last October 3, it was cancelled due to the events of 9/11.</p><p>The BMI Urban Awards recognize the songwriters and publishers of the most played urban songs on U.S. radio and television. An Urban Song of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Publisher of the Year will be named that night. BMI will also honor the Top Producers of 2001-2002 and the BMI writers whose songs hit the #1 spot on the Billboard R&B/Hip Hop Charts. The event will be held to coincide with Billboard's R&B/Hip Hop Conference & Awards.</p><p>James Brown will receive the BMI ICON Award for his contributions to music and the music business.<br>The first ICON Awards were presented last month to fellow pioneers Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little<br>Richard at the BMI Pop Awards.</p><p><b>Jon Faddis To Get Jazz Medal Of Honor</b><br></p><p><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/jonfad5931302.jpg border=1 align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The National Arts Club (NAC), founded in 1898 to stimulate, foster and promote public interest in the arts while educating the</p><p>American people in the fine arts, will present the distinguished Jazz Medal of Honor to world-renowned trumpet player, composer, arranger and educator Jon Faddis at a black tie dinner on June 13, at the historic Tilden Mansion in New York City.</p><p>Faddis, musical director of the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band for the past decade and Artist-in-Residence at the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College (SUNY), is the fifth honoree to receive the jazz award, joining pianist Dick Hyman, the JVC Jazz Festival, pianist George Shearing and saxophonist Benny Carter in taking home the coveted medal. The National Arts Club also annually presents the Gold Medal of Honor for Music; and since 1957, has bestowed the award upon Leonard Bernstein, Richard Rodgers, Sir Rudolf Bing, Alice Tully, Avery Fisher, Isaac Stern, Marian Andersen, Placido Domingo, Roberta Peters, Benny Goodman and other renowned musicians and patrons of the arts.</p><p>"Jon Faddis – a man whose lifetime contributions to jazz have enriched our cultural landscape – is the perfect recipient of the club's highest recognition," said O. Aldon James, Jr., president of the National Arts Club.</p><p>"I'm extremely pleased and proud to be the 2001-2002 recipient of the Jazz Medal of Honor," said Faddis. "To have my name placed among such luminaries of jazz and music is truly an honor and a blessing. Thanks to my parents, my instructors and my mentor and dear friend, the late Dizzy Gillespie, I learned early to dedicate myself to excellence. However, to achieve excellence and a true sense of purpose, a musician has to give out as much as he or she takes in. That's why it is so important for me to work with young people and push them toward their dreams. I'm honored that the National Arts Club has looked at my life's work and deemed it worthy to receive this award."<br></p><p><b>June 12 Benefit Set For Jazz Guitarist Barney Kessel</b><br></p><p><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/barneyk.jpg border=1 align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>A benefit concert for jazz guitarist Barney Kessel, who has been diagnosed<br>with terminal brain cancer, has been scheduled for June 1, at Birdland, located at 315 West 44th Street in New York City. Artists to perform<br>include George Benson, Jim Hall, Larry Coryell, John Scofield, George<br>Coleman, Ray Bryant, Harold Mabern, Chico Hamilton, John & Bucky Pizzarelli, Jimmy Cobb, Howard Alden, Mark Whitfield, AJ Lambert, Carl<br>Barry, Jack Wilkins, Eric Alexander, Gene Bertoncini, Ray Barretto,<br>Candido, Jackie Paris, Rodney Jones, Frank Wess, Benny Powell, Peter<br>Bernstein, Russell Malone, Vic Juris, Jimmy Bruno, Randy Johnston, Peter<br>Washington, Harvie S, Sean Smith, Steve La Spina, Chuck Redd, Gray<br>Sargeant, Lee Musiker, Kyle Eastwood, Ron Affif, Sabina Sciubba and Vinny<br>Valentino, with other special guests to be added. Tickets are $25 at the door; all proceeds from the show will go to assist Kessel.</p><p>"Barney Kessel stands tall as one of the dominant pillars of this music we<br>call jazz," says benefit organizer and producer Charles Carlini, a noted<br>guitar aficionado who has produced many tributes to legendary guitarists.<br>"His contributions are inestimable."</p><p>Known for his brilliant harmonic improvisation, bluesy and hard-driving<br>earthy style, Kessel is one of the swingingest players in jazz. A master<br>at pulling every last bit of emotion from a beautiful ballad, and at the<br>other extreme setting an audience on fire with an up tempo jazz standard,<br>he has also delighted audiences with his natural talent for standup comedy.</p><p>A composer and arranger (the jazz classic "Swedish Pastry" is perhaps his<br>best known tune), he was also a popular teacher who gave seminars and<br>workshops all over the world. Kessel originated the idea of the guitar<br>being used instead of a piano as the predominate voice of a jazz trio with<br>bass and drums. His five Poll Winners albums with Shelly Manne on drums and<br>Ray Brown on bass set the standard for all the guitar records that followed. Kessel was also the first to use the guitar to sound like a<br>full jazz orchestra. His landmark 1955 recording with Julie London, <i>Julie<br>is Her Name</i>, and its memorable "Cry Me a River," is an early example of his<br>ability to make arrangements, which bring out full orchestral tonal colors<br>with only a string bass and electric guitar. He was also the first in<br>modern jazz to use the flute and oboe on his recordings.</p><p>Kessel has played<br>and recorded with a long list of jazz greats including Lester Young,<br>Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Sarah Vaughn,<br>Ella Fitzgerald, Ben Webster and Sonny Rollins.</p><p>He is the author of the<br>book, "The Guitar," and has made three videos explaining his process of<br>improvisation in detail for Rumark Video.</p><p>At age 78, Kessel was diagnosed late last year with an inoperable tumor<br>(anaplastic astrocytoma) requiring 24-hour home care and therapy. He is<br>partially blind but is still able to talk on the telephone. Sadly,<br>he has no life insurance and has not worked in over 10 years due to a<br>massive stroke he suffered in 1992.</p><p>For those wishing to contribute to Barney's health care fund, checks can be<br>sent to</p><p>Mrs. Phyllis Kessel,</p><p>4445 North Avenue,</p><p>San Diego, CA 92116-3940<br></p><p><b>MTV Video Awards Latinoamerica Set For October 24</b><br></p><p><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/noticia_03.gif border=1 align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The inaugural "MTV Video Music Awards Latinoamerica" has been confirmed for October 24 at the Jackie Gleason Theater in Miami Beach.
