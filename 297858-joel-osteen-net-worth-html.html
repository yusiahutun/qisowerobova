So, how did Joel Osteen make his money?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d6b2bd90450ff088.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Heather Clem?

The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">renowned televangelist</a> is the head of Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. His father originally founded the church, but Joel invested in it and made it humongous. He was ordained as a minister of the big church by Lakewood’s member board in 1992</p><p class=align-left>The most interesting thing about Joel is that he does not take the $200,000 salary that he could be paid as a church pastor. Therefore, if you were wondering about Joel Osteen's salary, there you have it – he doesn't take anything from his massive church.</p><p class=align-left>He could easily accumulate his wealth considering the high amount, but he chooses to concentrate on his other sources of income. The church has an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">annual budget</a> of about $90 million.</p><p class=align-left>During the financial year ended March 31, 2017, and according to financial records obtained from the church, they spent the $90 million budget on the following:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e05b3268adef167.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dallas Yocum: Everything you need to know about Mike Lindell's wife</span></p></a><ul><li><strong>Weekly services and programs:</strong> $31.7 million</li><li><strong>Night of Hope events: </strong>$6.7 million</li><li><strong>TV ministry: </strong>$25.1 million</li><li><strong>General and administrative:</strong> $11.5 million</li><li><strong>Fundraising: </strong>$11.9 million</li><li><strong>Mission and outreach: </strong>$1.2 million</li></ul><h3>How much money does Joel Osteen make from his books?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/309553d724f759e0.jpeg><p class=align-left>The Joel Osteen’s net worth Forbes figure is huge because of his book revenue. Victoria and Joel Osteen are known as favourite <a href=#>celebrity</a> pastor couples. The two have been in the limelight for many things ranging from <a href=#>life-changing books</a> to news about their church.</p><p class=align-left>Their books seem to be a significant source of income, considering that Joel regularly publishes some of his best sellers. In addition, his approach to writing self-help books appears to be winning his audiences.</p><p class=align-left>And that is why most of Joel Osteen’s wealth comes from his books and is why he forfeits his church salary. The successful televangelist makes nearly $55 million every year from his books and speaking engagements.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a94e67144349a2cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are rapper Logic's parents?

He has since released other books that have done well over the years.</p><p class=align-left>Titles such as <i>8 Undeniable Qualities of a Winner, You can, You Will as well as Think Better, Live Better: A Victorious Life Begins in Your Mind</i> are among his best sellers. Therefore, it is not surprising that Joel has amassed enormous wealth over the years from book sales.</p><h3>How much does Joel make from speaking assignments?</h3><p class=align-left>In addition to his books, Joel makes a lot more money through his talks, and he has since ceased taking his salary from the church. The televangelist has numerous speaking engagements across America and the rest of the world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/890473d90c05afa9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Allen Covert bio: net worth, wife, movies, life story, what happened</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Joel <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">earns between</a> $100,000 - $200,000 from speaking assignments alone. Even though he is one of the most sought-after speakers, the televangelist avoids talking about controversial issues such as <a href=#>politics</a>, gay marriages, and abortion.</p><h3>Television viewership earnings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d6b2bd90450ff088.jpeg><p class=align-left>Another great income earning platform for the televangelist is television. Pastor Joel Osteen's programs are viewed by people worldwide that love his sermons.</p><p class=align-left>Even though there isn't an exact figure of how much he makes from TV and online streaming platforms like YouTube, it must be in millions. Another exciting thing is that the pastor doesn’t ask for money from his broadcasts.</p><h2>Joel Osteen’s house</h2><p class=align-left>One of the most significant resources that Joel Osteen is known for is his house. In fact, in 2010, his <a href=#>family</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">changed homes</a> to a prestigious 10.5 million dollars home in River Oaks, Texas. In addition to this, they continued to hold onto their previous $2.9 million estate. This is proof that Osteen has made considerable money to afford such a house.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The River Oaks house (17,000 square feet) is full of great amenities and numerous luxurious features. The house has 6 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, 5 open wood fireplaces, 3 elevators, a 1-bedroom guest house and a pool house.</p><p class=align-left>The house's design is one to admire as it has beautiful stone pillars that opens into a gorgeous entranceway. Also, its concrete driveway is quite massive and can fit over 20 cars.</p><h2>Joel Osteen’s car</h2><p class=align-left>The pastor was criticized after it emerged that he likely owns a Ferrari sports car that costs more than $300,000.</p><p class=align-left>However, it seems like the trending story was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">just a rumour</a> as the televangelist doesn't own such a car. But that doesn't mean that Joel doesn't own expensive cars, which he is yet to reveal as he doesn’t live the flashy lifestyle that would expose such properties.</p><h2>How much did Joel Osteen's church cost?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b38692bbdb32c161.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ross O'Donovan: divorce story, wife, sister, net worth, Game Grumps</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Lakewood Church relocated to the Compaq Centre on July 16, 2005, twice the size of its former sanctuary.

Joel and Victoria Osteen, his wife, lead a quiet life. The two are champions of prosperity gospel running a <a href=#>massive church</a>. With a sitting congregation of 38,000 congregants, it is evident that the church is self-sustaining.</p><h2>How much money does Lakewood Church give to charity?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e05b3268adef167.jpg><p class=align-left>Joel Osteen’s church has a yearly budget of $90 million. The amount goes towards different church activities, including outreach.
