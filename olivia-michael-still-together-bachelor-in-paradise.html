Keep reading to see if Olivia and Michael end up together after her dramatic breakup with John Henry.</p><p>Olivia Lewis (who was on The Bachelor Season 27) and Michael Barbour (who was on The Bachelorette Season 20) are two contestants on Bachelor in Paradise Season 9. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> is a spinoff of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelor</a> franchise premiered on ABC in March 2002 with businessman Alex Michel as the first Bachelor. The show has since aired for more than 27 seasons and produced several spin-offs including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelorette</a>,<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> Bachelor in Paradise</a>, Bachelor Pad, The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart, and The Bachelor Winter Games.&nbsp;</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> premiered in August 2014 as a reality TV dating series featuring former contestants from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. The show starts with an uneven number of women and men from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. Each week, there’s a Rose Ceremony where either the men or women give roses to the contestants they feel the strongest connection to. The contestants who don’t receive a rose are sent home.</p><p>The next week, the roles are reversed, and the gender that didn’t give out roses the previous week now chooses who to give a rose to and who to send home. Each week, more contestants from past seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette join the show to create an uneven number between the women and men and force the contestants already there to either couple up with someone new or stay in their current relationship. Contestants are also given date cards at random to choose contestants they want to spend alone time with. Many new contestants join the show with a date card.</p><p>At the end of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>, the contestants are offered an opportunity to have an overnight date with no cameras or microphones (much like Fantasy Suites on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.) After the overnight dates is the finale, where contestants either choose to break up or get engaged. Like The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, Bachelor in Paradise also has an “After the Final Rose” special, where contestants reunite to hash out drama and update viewers on their relationship.</p><p>But back to Olivia and Michael. So… are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Olivia and Michael still together from Bachelor in Paradise 2023</a> and did they get engaged in the BIP Season 9 finale? Read on for what happened to Olivia and Michael on Bachelor in Paradise 2023—and if they end up with each other.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.5><h2>Are Olivia and Michael still together from Bachelor in Paradise Season 9?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Olivia-Michael-Bachelor-in-Paradise.png><p>Are Olivia and Michael still together from Bachelor in Paradise 2023? The answer is no. Olivia Lewis (The Bachelor Season 27) and Michael Barbour (The Bachelorette Season 20) are not still together after Bachelor in Paradise Season 9, according to Reality Steve.</p><p>According to Reality Steve, only three couples ended up with each other and are still together from Bachelor in Paradise Season 9: Kylee Russell (The Bachelor Season 27) and Aven Jones (The Bachelorette Season 19); Kat Izzo (The Bachelor Season 27) and John Henry Spurlock (The Bachelorette Season 20); and Eliza Isichei (The Bachelor Season 26 and Bachelor in Paradise Season 8) and Aaron Bryant (The Bachelorette Season 20). Olivia and Michael were not among the couples still together from Bachelor in Paradise Season 9. Reality Steve reported that Kat and John Henry, and Eliza and Aaron B. got engaged, while Kylee and Aven left Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 together.</p><p>Before Michael arrived on Bachelor in Paradise Season 9, Olivia was involved in a love triangle with Kat and John Henry, who she had a One-on-One date with when he arrived on the beach. In the end, John Henry gave his rose to Kat at a Rose Ceremony, while Olivia remained single. During the rose ceremony, Olivia received a friendship rose from Brayden Bowers, who was on The Bachelorette Season 20, to keep her on the show.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5><h2>Who's Olivia from Bachelor in Paradise Season 9?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Olivia-Bachelor-in-Paradise-2023.jpg><p>Who’s Olivia from Bachelor in Paradise Season 9?
