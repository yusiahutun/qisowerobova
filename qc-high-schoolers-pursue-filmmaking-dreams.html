They were based at Augustana in Rock Island seven years, and after less than a year at Moline’s Spotlight Theatre, they are renovating a vacant 1912 home in downtown Rock Island (428 19th St.), next to Project NOW, for new headquarters, a small studio and production space to host a growing number of programs.</p><p>They now include both the weekly program for high school students (at Central, Rock Island High, and soon in the new HQ), as well as a training program for 18-to-29-year-olds that pays a $1,100 stipend.</p><p>“This is all student-driven – the one thing I love about Fresh Films is, I shift my hats,” said Clint Balsar, art department chair at Central and visual arts chair for the <a href=#>Creative Arts Academy of the Quad Cities</a>, which is based at Central and Sudlow Intermediate in Davenport. This is his third year coordinating the Fresh Films after-school program, which meets Tuesdays and Thursdays 4-6 p.m.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/FF22.jpg><p>“All day long, I’ve been a teacher at Central. Now all I am is an assistant. I teach some of the methods you use in film, but this is a student-driven project,” he said Thursday.</p><p>The Fresh Films weekly program is a hands-on filmmaking program that builds fundamental film and video skills, as well as industry connections and confidence, said Kelli Feigley, Fresh Films managing director and executive producer.</p><p>“Youth are exposed to the vast career opportunities and build skills to get there,” she said. “They work with professional equipment and learn from Hollywood pros&nbsp;from Sony, Roku, Paramount and all for free!”</p><p>Each program has multiple projects including: developing a documentary that has the chance to stream to over 70 million users on The Roku Channel, making a music video for a real band, producing a competition&nbsp;show with the team from Fremantle (“American Idol”), and creating a short film with Sony Pictures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/FF23.jpg><p>Fresh Films started at Central this school year in November, and this week the kids worked on a music video for a song by the <a href=#>QC indie rock band Subatlantic</a>. Often, they have Fresh Films Zoom meetings with other schools.</p><p>Last year, the program did a music video for a Peoria band. The new video is a concept piece using the music as soundtrack (there is no dialogue), but not filming the band itself.</p><p>The concept is filming a student (sophomore Hal Sprague) working on an essay. The song is a happy, road-trippy mood, and the student struggles but figures it out, and by the end is happy and bouncy, matching the song’s vibe, Balsar said.</p><p>There are 16 students involved, including sound, lighting, props, location, camera operating, storyboarding, etc. Hal is the only subject on camera.</p><p>“One of the things they truly learn is in the filmmaking process is, it’s all crew, it’s all team,” Balsar said. The video includes planning, filming and editing in post-production.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/FF20.jpg><p>“It works out really well to be the third year working with Fresh Films, too, ‘cause I have several who keep coming back,” he said.</p><p>Fresh Films partners with several entertainment companies, like Roku, which has national documentary contests that could potentially air on Roku. Sony and Paramount are also partners.</p><p>That Roku program is called <a href=#>“Change Makers,”</a> highlighting people who’ve made a huge impact in their community, Balsar said. Last school year, the Central students did a short doc about <a href=#>Abigail Johnson</a> – a Blue Grass teen who started her own nonprofit to help veterans learn technology. She was named the 2022-2023 American Legion Auxiliary National Junior Member of the Year.</p><p>Students have to apply to be in Fresh Films, Balsar said.</p><p><strong>Student experiences</strong></p><p>Four Davenport Central students traveled to Dallas this past summer as part of their internship&nbsp;with Fresh Films, where they worked on-set of new show “Job GPS” and filmed an episode with an American Airlines pilot and a digital advertising&nbsp;agency.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/FF18.jpg><p>Central junior Fox Dobbins was one of the four in that internship (including students from around the country), over a week, in partnership with American Airlines and Roku.</p><p>“I liked working on an actual set, with real deadlines and a real client,” he said Thursday, planning to do another internship this summer.</p><p>Fox got involved in Fresh Films his freshman year through Creative Arts Academy (which he began in 6th grade).</p><p>The first two years, he learned camera and lighting setups, as well as acting and editing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/FF19.jpg><p>“I always like doing camera work, cinematography,” Fox said, noting he prefers being behind the camera versus in front.</p><p>His favorite directors are <a href=#>Stanley Kubrick</a> and <a href=#>Rian Johnson</a> (especially his “Knives Out”).</p><p>“They have their own variety and they pay attention to detail, which I really like,” Fox said. His favorite Kubrick films are “The Shining” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.”</p><p>This year, Fresh Films has provided more equipment than past years.</p><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Fresh films coming to Fresh Films free event">Fresh films coming to Fresh Films free event</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="New Fresh Films | Jonathan Turner">New Fresh Films | Jonathan Turner</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="REVIEW: New Fresh Films doc is heartwarming, inspiring">REVIEW: New Fresh Films doc is heartwarming, inspiring</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Fresh Films sharing love of film production with Quad Cities teens">Fresh Films sharing love of film production with&nbsp;…</a></h3></li></ul><p>Fox may look for jobs at a production studio right after high school. “I’m looking more for work than school,” he said.</p><p>Rebecca Patrick, a Central junior, is in her second year with Fresh Films. She took a camera and lighting fundamentals class with Balsar last year before starting this program.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/FF13.jpg><p>Rebecca liked doing the documentary project the most. For the new music video, she is director of photography, filming the main camera.</p><p>“I’m learning teamwork skills and I like to find out a lot of things,” Rebecca said. “It’s fun for me, which is weird because not a lot of people like the planning part, but I like the planning part.”</p><p>She said she doesn’t watch movies a lot (not even “Barbie”). She got interested in filmmaking because Balsar is a really good teacher, she said. “Why not try Fresh Films?” Rebecca said. She enjoys teamwork because she gets to tell other students what to do.</p><p>“I’m really good at that,” she said. “I don’t like feeling I’m too bossy.” Rebecca really wants to get into photography after high school.</p><p>“I like learning a lot about new art process,” Hal Sprague said, who called himself more a visual artist. “That’s made me want to join this, ‘cause it’s something new.”</p><p>He has done Metro Arts with Quad City Arts, working on the Sgt. Pepper’s mural in downtown Davenport.</p><p><strong>New accelerated program</strong></p><p>Not only does Fresh Films work with high schoolers (75 in the QC, plus 500-600 more including Twin Cities, Chicago, Boston, L.A., Seattle, Atlanta, New York, Pittsburgh, Memphis, and virtually), they have a new accelerated training program to kick-start careers for those new to the field in film, TV and other media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/FF12.png><p>The Accelerated Film Training Program is a competitive paid program that will advance your skills and connections to access jobs in the rapidly growing film and TV industry.

In 2002, he formed production company Fresh Films/Dreaming Tree Films, which began work in Chicago, directing commercial and short film productions for the Art Institute of Chicago and the City of Chicago, winning awards with the Chicago International Film Festival.</p><p>To date, Estlin’s production resume includes directing over 200 films, TV episodes, commercials and documentaries, and he continues to engage future filmmakers via Fresh Films, which moved onto the Augie campus in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/FF16.jpg><p>Estlin’s TV and feature film directing credits include “<a href=#>The Stream</a>” starring Rainn Wilson, Mario Lopez, Christopher Gorham and Kelly Rutherford. The film was called “A Family Friendly Stand By Me” by the Washington Post and released theatrically at Regal Cinemas, the film is currently on Roku, Amazon Prime, iTunes and continues to play internationally on Fox Family Asia and AMC EU channels in various countries.</p><p>Estlin also co-wrote and directed “<a href=#>Alternate Universe: A Rescue Mission</a>”, starring Steve Guttenberg and Harry Lennix, which premiered at the White House STEM Festival and is currently playing on Paramount +, Redbox and other platforms.
