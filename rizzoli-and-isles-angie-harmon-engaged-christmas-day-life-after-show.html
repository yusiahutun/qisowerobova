Since the show stopped airing, the actress has focused on improving her life and building a family.</strong></p><p>When it comes to juggling between work and career, no one does it better than the “Rizzoli And Isles” actress, Angie Harmon. The 48-year-old rose to Hollywood stardom in the late nineties, starring in notable films and television shows.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>While building her acting career, the actress strived to maintain a successful family. Today, she is a mother to three daughters from her ex-husband, Jason Sehorn. Additionally, she has been <a href=#>engaged</a> to actor Greg Vaughan since December 2019.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=ANGIE_HARMONS_FAMILY></span><strong>ANGIE HARMON’S FAMILY</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The “Rizzoli And Isles” star and Sehorn became engaged in March 2000, shortly after their relationship kicked off. The retired NFL player popped the big question during the actress’s guest appearance on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.” They tied the knot in June the next year, marking the beginning of their lives together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The duo became first-time parents in October 2013, following the birth of their daughter, Finley Faith. Two years later, their second daughter, Avery Grace, born June 2005, joined the family. Harmon and Sehorn’s youngest daughter, Emery Hope arrived in December 2008.</p><p>The couple and their <a href=#>kids</a> appeared as the perfect family of five for years. Things went south in 2014, with Harmon and Sehorn announcing their split by November that year. They finalized the divorce in 2016, the same year the actress said goodbye to her days as Jane Rizzoli.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=HARMONS_LIFE_AFTER_THE_SHOW></span><strong>HARMON’S LIFE AFTER THE SHOW</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The final episode of “Rizzoli And Isles” aired in July 2016, bringing an end to its seven-seasons run. After playing the headstrong Detective Jane Rizzoli for six years on the TNT series, Harmon, like other members of the cast, moved on to other projects.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>During an interview ahead of the show’s final episode, the actress disclosed some of her plans for the future, including her directional aspirations. She <a href=#>shared</a>:</p><p><strong>“I have a movie I would like to direct and I would certainly like to take some time off and spend it with my kids.”</strong></p><p>Angie Harmon made do with her plans, taking a hiatus from acting and focusing on raising her Kids. In 2017, the icon came out from her hiatus to <a href=#>voice</a> three episodes of the animation, “Voltron: Legendary Defender.” Angie Harmon also appeared in an episode of the 2020 film, “Match Game.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=OTHER_SHOWS_AND_MOVIES></span><strong>OTHER SHOWS AND MOVIES</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>According to Angie Harmon’s bio, she forayed into the entertainment industry in 1995, after producer David Hasselhoff discovered her on a plane. She soon snagged a role as the lead character on “Baywatch Nights,” 1995. The next year, she played Amanda Reardon in twelve episodes of “C-16: FBI,” before landing a role in “Lawn Dog,” 1998.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJaC_Bis5q3/?igshid=rk2jmela8wus</p></figure><p>Harmon made her big break in 1998 when she was cast as Abbie Carmichael in the NBC series, Law & Order.” She remained on the show until 2001 before leaving to pursue more film roles. The icon went on to star in “Good Advice,” “Agent Cody Banks,” “End Game,” “Seraphim Falls,” and “The Deal.”</p><p>Her other <a href=#>acting gigs</a> include “Samantha Who,” “Chuck,” “Women’s Murder Club,” and “Living Proof,” among others.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=HARMONS_CHRISTMAS_ENGAGEMENT></span><strong>HARMON’S CHRISTMAS ENGAGEMENT</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Three years after Angie Harmon’s divorce from her husband, Sehorn, the actress became <a href=#>engaged</a> to actor, Greg Vaughan. The couple announced their engagement on 2019’s Christmas Day, sharing a series of pictures from the memorable moment on social media.</p><p>Taking to Instagram, Angie Harmon posted a snap of them at the bottom of the stairs, with Vaughan kneeling on one knee in front of her. Her stunned expression and the sparkler on her finger gave away the symbolism of the moment.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6gZtEalqer/?igshid=qf5hkt0q76yf</p></figure><p>Another of the shots <a href=#>featured</a> the couple standing at the bottom stairs, with Harmon’s three <a href=#>daughters</a> and Vaughan’s three sons lined up behind them in a single file.</p><p>Like his fiancé, the “Days Of Our Lives” actor has been married once, to model and actress, Touriya Haoud.
