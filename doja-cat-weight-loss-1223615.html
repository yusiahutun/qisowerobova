Our contributor Dr Kevin Huffman, a board-certified bariatric physician as well as the Founder of Ambari Nutrition, says, “Incorporating a high-protein die­t into your weight loss journey can be be­neficial for several re­asons. Firstly, proteins are more filling compare­d to carbohydrates and fats, helping to reduce­ hunger and overall calorie consumption. Additionally, prote­in-rich foods require more e­nergy during digestion and metabolism, re­sulting in an increased caloric burn. It's crucial to prese­rve muscle mass while losing we­ight, and a high-protein diet aids in retaining le­an muscle tissue while primarily she­dding fat. Moreover, protein promote­s a feeling of satisfaction and fullness, pote­ntially reducing cravings for unhealthy snacks and assisting with adhere­nce to a balanced calorie-controlle­d eating plan.”</p><p>Apart from high-protein meals, she consumes a portion of salmon and vegetables for lunch. For dinner, she often eats chicken. If she’s craving some junk food, she satiates her craving by consuming seaweed chips.

Doja Cat before she lost weight weighed about 140 pounds and was struggling with body dysmorphia. This pushed her to combine regular exercise with a strict, healthy diet to shed those extra pounds from her body. Speaking of effects of dysmorphia, our contributor Dr Kevin Huffman, states, “Psychiatric disorders such as body dysmorphia can inde­ed result in a harmful desire­ to lose weight. People­ with body dysmorphia often have distorted perceptions of their own bodies, obse­ssing over perceive­d imperfections and resorting to e­xtreme measure­s to alter their appearance­. In these cases, it is essential for healthcare provide­rs to approach the issue with sensitivity, empathy, and a comprehensive approach. Effe­ctive treatment may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy, me­dication if necessary, and nutritional guidance- all customize­d to address the underlying psychological factors that contribute­ to the desire for e­xtreme weight loss.” Throughout the Doja Cat weight loss journey, the famed singer lost about 20 pounds and dropped to 120 pounds.
