I’m not going to say that I’m married to a polo-and-khakis or a button-down-and- khakis look, but I just like someone who is put together. Whatever their style may be, as long as it’s clear they’re put together and put a little thought into it, and that they take pride in their appearance…I am a Southern girl, in heart and in mind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biogossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kaylee-Hartung.jpg><p>Previously, Kaylee mentioned her boyfriend in an Instagram image but she never spoke about that topic in the public.
