His biological father passed away when Bob was still young, so he lived with his mother, Matilda, until he got to eighth grade. He grew up in South Dakota, on the Rosebud Indian Reservation.</p><p class=align-left>His mother would later remarry, and the <a href=#>family</a> moved to Springfield, Missouri. Details of his siblings, if any, have remained under wraps. His stepfather also remains a mystery.</p><h2>Education</h2><p class=align-left>Barker attended an unknown local high school before proceeding to join Drury College in Springfield. In 1943, he joined the United States Naval Reserve to train as a fighter <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/349369-how-a-pilot-kenya.html href=#>pilot</a> during World War 2.
