From tornadoes to climate change and scary-looking things, you will be surprised by what most people consider scary. However, scary things can also extend to human beings.</p><p class=align-left>The world has seen humans who have done dreadful things. From the unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper to dictators like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, these are examples of humans who scared the world and caused a lot of destruction.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2acd40b4918ff13c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>At San Francisco expo, AI 'sorry' for destroying humanity</span></p></a><h2>Who is the creepiest person in the world?</h2><p class=align-left>Jeffrey Dahmer is considered the creepiest person in the world. He was an American serial killer and se*x offender who murdered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. People called him the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster because he dismembered his victims, cannibalised them, and permanently preserved their body parts.</p><h2>What is the scariest thing in the world?</h2><p class=align-left>People have fears and phobias that make their hearts race and their palms sweat. From spiders to heights, what scares humans is often a personal and subjective experience. However, certain things are commonly perceived as the scariest things in the world. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Teal Mango</a>, there are 15 of them.</p><h3>1. Death</h3><p class=align-left>Death is really scary stuff to even talk about it to anybody. People fear death because it is an unknown state, and the uncertainty surrounding what happens after one dies can be unsettling. Also, the prospect of dying can make a person confront their mortality and the finite nature of life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9efbce286f77d96e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 funniest libra memes that perfectly describe this zodiac sign</span></p></a><h3>2. Being buried alive</h3><p class=align-left>To be buried alive is one of the horrifying things humans would rather avoid. That is because the fear of being buried alive, known as taphophobia, brings the idea of being trapped in a confined space, in complete darkness, with no escape.</p><p class=align-left>That thought of being alone and almost dying makes anyone feel claustrophobic and helpless. Also, being buried alive represents a particularly gruesome and painful death, and the idea of dying in such a way is understandably disturbing to many people.</p><h3>3. Spiders</h3><p class=align-left>People find spiders scary because of different reasons. For example, spiders have long legs, sharp fangs, and a potentially venomous bite. Also, the fear of the unknown makes people scared of spiders since they can often be found in dark, secluded places and quickly scurry away before they are seen. And past experiences with spiders, such as spider bites, can contribute to a fear or phobia of the animals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/14417b66ba8bd195.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 Disney movies with cats and feline animations to watch right now</span></p></a><h3>4. Heights</h3><p class=align-left>Heights are one of the most scary things worldwide. People fear heights because it is an evolutionary response designed to keep humans safe from falls. Also, the fear of heights is an innate biological response that has evolved in humans as a protective mechanism against injury and death, which humans try to avoid.</p><h3>5. Public speaking</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2acd40b4918ff13c.jpg><p class=align-left>Public speaking can be scary for several reasons. One factor is that people may overestimate the importance of the speech or presentation they are giving, which can cause them to feel a lot of pressure to do well.</p><p class=align-left>Many people fear being judged or criticised by their audience, which can cause <a href=#>anxiety and nervousness. </a>Besides, the fear of judgment is rooted in ancient evolutionary instincts developed to protect humans from social rejection or exclusion.</p><h3>6. Snakes</h3><p class=align-left>Snakes are universally the creepiest thing in the world. First, <a href=#>many snakes</a> are venomous and can threaten humans if they feel threatened or cornered. Even non-venomous snakes can bite and cause injury. Also, the misconceptions about snakes, such as the belief that they are naturally aggressive and their association with witchcraft in certain societies, make people afraid.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e945a9b6ebfd47fd.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ ugly cartoon characters, ranked by popularity in 2024</span></p></a><h3>7. Darkness</h3><p class=align-left>Darkness can be scary because people associate it with the unknown and uncertainty. When somebody is in the dark, they can start imagining things that are not there. Also, humans have evolved to rely heavily on visual cues for survival. Therefore, the inability to see clearly in the dark can create a sense of vulnerability, leading to fear.</p><h3>8. Claustrophobia</h3><p class=align-left>Claustrophobia is an irrational fear of enclosed or tight spaces. Human beings are social beings. Therefore, staying in an enclosed or tight space alone can cause intense panic, anxiety, and physical discomfort.</p><p class=align-left>The idea of being trapped, unable to escape, or losing control can overwhelm many people with claustrophobia. It can severely limit their ability to take part in everyday activities.</p><h3>9. Failure</h3><p class=align-left>Failure is arguably the greatest fear of all. That is because failing may lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment, which can be a <a href=#>strong motivator </a>for avoiding failure. Also, failure can lead to uncertainty about the future and what comes next.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c40bcfa79b9bceac.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Clones, noseprints, flying taxis: Sci-fi meets reality at expo</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Failing may result in losing time, money, resources, or opportunities, which can be challenging to accept. People also fear failing because it may prompt feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt and lead to negative judgments from others, which can be difficult to manage and damage self-esteem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9efbce286f77d96e.jpg><h3>10. Deep fake technology</h3><p class=align-left>The dark web, hackers, and viruses are scary. But deep fake technology is the scariest thing ever on the internet. Deep fake technology is creepy and alarming because it allows anyone with a computer and internet connection to create<a href=#> realistic-looking photos</a> and videos of people saying or doing things they never actually did.</p><p class=align-left>People have used this technology for various nefarious purposes, including cyber threats, political propaganda, disinformation campaigns, and <a href=#>entertainment</a>. Also, deep fake technology is advancing rapidly, making detecting flaws and identifying what is real and unreal more challenging. Thus, it poses a significant threat to individuals, organisations, and society.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1752f2c6f26778b6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 most weird paintings that are unusual in the art world</span></p></a><h3>11. Diseases</h3><p class=align-left>Some diseases are scary because they always bring suffering and elicit the thought of death. Diseases, especially those that lack effective treatments, may make the victim helpless and scared.</p><p class=align-left>Their loved ones also get into the mix because it drains their emotions, time, and finances. Furthermore, some diseases are stigmatised. Thus, they can lead to discrimination and social ostracism for people with them, increasing fear and anxiety around the disease.</p><h3>12. Nuclear weapons</h3><p class=align-left>Nuclear weapons are scary because they are the most destructive and powerful weapons ever created. A single nuclear bomb can kill tens or even hundreds of thousands of people instantly, and the radiation emitted by a nuclear explosion can cause lasting damage to the environment and human health.</p><p class=align-left>The use of multiple nuclear bombs could even disrupt the global climate, potentially causing a mass extinction event. Furthermore, the fear of mutually assured destruction in a nuclear war has contributed to a sense of unease and uncertainty around the world. The potential for accidental launch or miscalculation during a crisis adds to the fear associated with nuclear weapons.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c8f68db5d6f6885.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why is anarchism associated with contemporary radical politics?</span></p></a><h3>13. Horror movies</h3><p class=align-left>Some horror movies are so scary that many cannot sleep at night after watching them. That is because the films bring out feelings of fear, anxiety, and suspense. Also, <a href=#>horror movies </a>often feature themes such as death, violence, the supernatural, and the unknown, which can all be sources of fear for many people.</p><p class=align-left>Dark lighting, eerie music, and sudden jump scares can elicit a physiological response in the viewer, like an increased heart rate and rapid breathing, further enhancing the sense of fear and unease.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/14417b66ba8bd195.jpeg><h3>14. Torture</h3><p class=align-left>Torture is scary because it involves the intentional infliction of physical or psychological pain and suffering on a person. It is also used as a means of punishment or interrogation, and the experience can be traumatising and have long-lasting psychological effects on the victim. Additionally, the fear of torture can be used to control, as individuals may alter their behaviour or beliefs to avoid suffering.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c769d4099fc7e89.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>5 types of generational curses and their references in the Bible</span></p></a><h3>15. The Church of Bones</h3><p class=align-left>The Church of Bones in the Czech Republic is scary because it displays human bones and skeletons. The display of more than 70,000 bones exhumed from a graveyard and arranged in various patterns and structures creates an eerie and unsettling atmosphere. Some people may find this display of human remains creepy or disturbing, especially if they are not used to seeing such things.</p><p class=align-left>Fear is subjective, and the scariest thing in the world may not necessarily scare another person. However, some scary things are universal. For example, snakes, spiders, death, buried alive, and heights are some of the most common triggers of fears and phobias that make people’s hearts race and palms sweat. And if you have used the internet, you will know that while viruses and hackers are scary, deep fake technology is universally the most frightening thing on the internet.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about the most<a href=#> dangerous jungles</a> in the world.
