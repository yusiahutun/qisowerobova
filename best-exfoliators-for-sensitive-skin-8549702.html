But as important as it is, exfoliation isn’t always feasible for sensitive skin, since the very <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>act of exfoliating</a> — that is, removing dead skin cells from skin’s surface — is inherently a delicate process. For those with reactive skin, it's especially important to consider the<strong> type of formula</strong> — physical or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>chemical</a> — that you use as choosing the wrong one can “potentially leave your skin red, tender, and sensitive,” says&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Dr. Rachel Nazarian</a>, a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology in New York City.&nbsp;The good news? New, <strong>super-gentle formulas </strong>can both deliver the benefits of exfoliation while leaving skin <strong>calm and comfortable</strong>, giving you the best of both worlds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To determine just that, a group of<strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle editors tested</a> 15 exfoliators specifically developed for sensitive skin</strong> by integrating them into their regular skincare routines for <strong>four weeks. </strong>Editors evaluated each one against a set of criteria, keeping an eye out for the <strong>formula's texture</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong> and the way it <strong>felt on the skin</strong>, and of course, <strong>the results</strong> each one delivered both immediately as well as at the end of the month.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Consider Your Skin Goals</span><p>“Generally, oily skin types or combination skin can tolerate physical exfoliants better,” says Dr. Nazarian. Meanwhile, people with sensitive skin, or those living with skin conditions like rosacea and acne, tend to do better with chemical exfoliants. “If you’re looking to treat acne, salicylic acid can be useful to unclog pores, but also decrease acne inflammation,” says Dr. Nazarian. “Glycolic acid is an exfoliator that can increase hyaluronic acid production, a great substance to improve dry skin, and lactic acid has been shown to improve hyperpigmentation as well as texture.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-sunday-riley-good-genes-all-in-one-lactic-acid-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sunday Riley Good Genes Lactic Acid Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sunday Riley Good Genes All-in-One Lactic Acid Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dWsDtJrg4X5gibqutzmk75IXlA8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sunday-riley-good-genes-all-in-one-lactic-acid-treatment-4a5d5eaf5aee43c0838afd38d8a93532.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It can improve skin on a number of fronts, like dark spots and dryness</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It was a little too harsh for very sensitive skin types, so patch-test it first.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than a scrub, this is a <strong>lightweight cream</strong> that <strong>feels smooth and silky</strong>; you can either <strong>leave it on overnight or wash it off after 15 minutes</strong> (we opted for the former). The first few times we used it, our skin tingled slightly, although it never hurt — and we eventually stopped feeling any sensation when we applied it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And it was worth sticking with: Every time we applied it, we noticed that our skin felt <strong>smoother, softer, and even more hydrated</strong>. In fact, our <strong>fine lines on our forehead looked less visible</strong> after we used it for a month, as did the bumpy texture on our cheeks. While we're still waiting to see a change in our hyperpigmentation, we're convinced enough to stick with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Chemical<strong>｜Key Ingredients:</strong> Lactic acid, licorice, arnica, aloe<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Signs of sun damage<strong>｜Usage:</strong> Apply 1-2 pumps to skin<strong>｜Size:</strong> 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-exfoliator-for-oily-sensitive-skin-pca-skin-pore-refining-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Exfoliator for Oily, Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PCA Skin Pore Refining Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="PCA Skin Pore Refining Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/a24p2t-7--Wvlw6KqpvFw59X0B4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pca-skin-pore-refining-treatment--1096a5d9ac9b42f5b18358ac90e14bd9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PCA Skin&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It helped control our excess oil production without stripping skin of its moisture.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It’s one of the more expensive exfoliating scrubs we’ve tested.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There's no rule saying you have to stick with just one type of exfoliation. In fact, doubling up — as with this scrub, which pairs chemical and physical exfoliants — can actually be great for some skin types. We set out hoping that the combination of <strong>alpha hydroxy acid, fruit enzymes, rice powder, and oil-absorbing clay</strong> would smooth our overall skin texture and shrink the look of our large pores, and did it ever deliver.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than feeling like overkill, the texture of the scrub was <strong>creamy</strong> with just a<strong> little grit</strong>. We saw less congestion on our cheeks; where we're especially prone to breakouts. Another perk is that our T-zone seemed to be <strong>less oily</strong> after using this scrub, but our skin<strong> never felt dried out</strong> or stripped of moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Hybrid｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Mandelic acid, papain, rice powder, kaolin clay｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Oily or breakout-prone skin types｜<strong>Usage:</strong> After cleansing, apply and massage it in gentle circular motions｜<strong>Size:</strong> 2.1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-gentle-exfoliator-for-very-sensitive-skin-peter-thomas-roth-firmx-exfoliating-peeling-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Gentle Exfoliator for Very Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Peter Thomas Roth FirmX Exfoliating Peeling Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Peter Thomas Roth FirmX Exfoliating Peeling Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OLxDuS74QEOZZFxHVIr3d3pefk4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Peter-Thomas-Roth-FirmX-Exfoliating-Peeling-Gel-5fb92e4726dd45298474a75724e9d853.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It didn’t inflame our highly reactive skin, and it did make skin feel smoother.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The results didn’t wow us as much as we’d hoped.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If seeing is believing, then you can trust the results of this<strong> peeling gel</strong>, which literally rolls dead skin away with a combination of cellulose, plus<strong> pineapple and pomegranate enzymes</strong>. We rubbed this onto freshly cleansed skin and our skin was <strong>noticeably softer and smoother</strong>, and we experienced <strong>zero redness or dryness</strong> as a result, which was a huge plus for us. In fact, our skin still <strong>felt moisturized</strong> after we used it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only downside is that we didn't see much of an improvement in our skin tone and all-around radiance like we'd hoped.

In an effort to smooth and soften our skin, we alternated our evening retinol with the overnight cream, which uses <strong>glycolic acid to dissolve</strong> the glue (aka excess oil and gunk) that holds together dead skin cells — allowing them to slough off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a <strong>chemical peel-type product</strong>, it was <strong>surprisingly gentle</strong>; in fact, we were able to skip our moisturizer after applying a pea-size amount. Since using this, we've found that our <strong>clogged pores have disappeared</strong>, and we no longer get errant whiteheads. Overall, our <strong>skin looks more radiant</strong>, putting this among our best exfoliators for uneven skin tone. Worth keeping in mind is that even though our skin didn't feel overly dry, it did feel a little more sensitive than usual in the mornings, even though we regularly use retinol and alpha hydroxy acids. And it made us more sensitive to sunlight, so we felt a little irritation after a day outdoors. Still, we think it’s worth it for one of the <strong>best brightening exfoliators</strong> out there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Chemical｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Glycolic acid, phytic acid, jojoba oil, sunflower seed oil｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Dullness or discoloration｜<strong>Usage:</strong> Smooth a pea-sized amount over face and neck｜<strong>Size:</strong> 1.7 fl oz<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-exfoliator-for-sensitive-skin-and-rosacea-dermalogica-daily-milkfoliant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Exfoliator for Sensitive Skin and Rosacea</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dermalogica Daily Milkfoliant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermalogica Daily Milkfoliant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BeN6MFCZTwQLXOcc-PR9pZsMRf8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dermalogica-daily-milkfoliant--d07b70e1efcc4e4291676f8c25cb298c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermalogica</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It won’t upset or irritate even the most sensitive skin types, and actually can help alleviate certain symptoms.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The powder format can take a little getting used to.

The only hiccup we found was knowing how much powder and water was needing to make the exfoliating paste for our whole face. We tried this product in the middle of an eczema flare-up, since it contains <strong>oat bran extract</strong> (which is known for its ability to soothe skin), and woke up to <strong>calmer skin</strong> in the morning, with <strong>less burning and irritation.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, it has the exfoliating action of the <strong>alpha hydroxy acids, beta hydroxy acids, and fruit enzymes</strong>, which made our <strong>skin look brighter</strong> and <strong>more even</strong> in tone.

But that can be tough if you have sensitive skin, too. That's where this<strong> peel exfoliant </strong>stands out. It uses a gommage method — meaning it kind of <strong>balls up </strong>dead skin cells, excess oil, and other debris, which you then rinse off — along with mild resurfacing, courtesy of <strong>fruit enzymes</strong>. We immediately liked the <strong>cool, jelly-like texture</strong>, and appreciated that it didn't seem to create any redness as we rubbed it into our skin.

These days, you can find hybrid formulas that include a blend of the two and are still gentle enough for sensitive skin. “Physical exfoliants that have smaller, more delicate exfoliating particles can be tolerated by many different skin types,” says Dr. Nazarian. “Ones that are most superficial, such as mandelic acid, are the most gentle,” she says. “The deeper you exfoliate, such as with glycolic, the more aggressive the chemical peel.” She also points to salicylic and lactic acids as two more superficial chemical exfoliants to consider.</li><li><strong>Time on Skin</strong>: “Those with sensitive skin can absolutely use a leave-on peel so long as it is very mild,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Geeta Yadav</a>, a board-certified dermatologist based in Toronto; she points to polyhydroxy acid as a good ingredient for this, as their large size means they can’t penetrate that deeply. “While the concept of a short-contact exfoliator makes sense in regard to limiting irritation, if it uses large granules of something highly abrasive like crushed walnut shells, that would be far more damaging to the skin than a light peel,” she says.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Should you exfoliate if you have sensitive skin?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can and you should. “Unless your skin barrier has been highly compromised due to skin conditions like eczema or over-exfoliation from a prescription retinoid, you should exfoliate,” says Dr. Yadav.

After all, “removal of the top layers of cells leaves you more sensitive to sunlight, radiation, and burns,” says Dr. Nazarian.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should people with sensitive skin exfoliate?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Nazarian recommends exfoliating once or twice a week, max, and to skip it on days you use a retinoid or other potentially irritating ingredients. “Use it on clean skin, and follow up with a gentle calming moisturizer,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is physical or chemical exfoliation better for sensitive skin?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both our experts agree that chemical exfoliation tends to be better for sensitive skin.
