If so, then you’d be right!&nbsp;</p><p id=eDghnH9zHJl data-wc=60>The island has grown in popularity over the years, and has become a hot spot for young holidaymakers to visit - but it can be tricky to even begin to know where to start with so many hotels, beach clubs, restaurants and clubs at your fingertips. Here are our best recommendations to enjoy a stay in Mykonos like no other…&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>WHERE TO STAY&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3>Santa Marina Resort&nbsp;</h3><p id=ecn66R9Jbee data-wc=48><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Santa Marina Resort </a>is a five-star property looking over the sparkling Aegean Ocean. Complete with a spa, infinity pool and private beach - as well as a pier dotted with cosy sun loungers, there is nothing about this resort that isn’t - in a word - perfect.</p><h5><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BOOK HERE</a></h5><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d7f3b2dd5fc7-beach-front-z.jpg><p id=eXMdeEP7EoH data-wc=66>Upon arrival, we were immediately impressed by the curved driveway and sweeping steps, where a host of friendly staff was on hand to help to the light and open reception to check-in. The team at the desk couldn’t have done more to help us with our stay, from bringing us ironing boards to calling our taxis for us. They were also great for giving recommendations too!&nbsp;</p><p id=eKQ9X_NGpC data-wc=12><strong>LOOK: <a class=hm-link href=#>What you need to pack for a holiday: 90 must-have items</a></strong></p><p id=e8k_OvA46bj data-wc=65>We were very impressed by the hotel's gorgeous room. Large and airy with crisp white bedding, as well as a spacious bathroom full of amenities and a wide balcony with the most sensational views, it was exactly what you'd wish for a home away from home. Tip: be sure to watch the sunset there with a glass of fizz on hand, it is simply beautiful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/63640b563212-mykonos-pool-z.jpg><p id=eh-vslzOqHs data-wc=73>The resort is certainly sprawling, with plenty to do on the grounds. For those who love to rest and relax, the hotel’s signature feature is a large, stunning infinity pool overlooking some beautiful views. It comes with stylish pool beds and swinging seats, and with waiters on hand to help with anything you need - be it a hangover cure smoothie or some small bites to snack on during a hot summer's day. &nbsp;</p><p id=em3C8fEBCI_ data-wc=46>The resort also boasts a gorgeous spa just a stone’s throw from the unique pool, which has an array of gorgeous treatments. During my stay, I opted for an ESPA Intense Regenerating Facial, with left my tired and dry post-party skin feeling rejuvenated - a must-visit!</p><p id=ewEgOjoofVO data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Discover 5* Egyptian luxury with a stay at The Chedi El Gouna</a></p><p id=eVjDuJflNo data-wc=13><strong>MORE:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;The ultimate guide to Memphis: Where to stay and what to do</a></p><p id=eODXeWhpDvn0 data-wc=67>Santa Marina also had a boat on hand as a method of transport for partygoers to Scorpios in the most luxurious of ways - so just forget about calling a taxi! As for the resort restaurants - Mykonos Social by Jason Atherton and Buddha Bar - the food was some of the best we enjoyed during our stay, and we have elaborated on our dinner recommendations below...</p><h2><strong>BEST RESTAURANTS IN&nbsp;MYKONOS</strong></h2><h3>Buddha Bar&nbsp;</h3><p id=eqKGTlnh8QUf data-wc=71>The restaurant is located right by the Santa Marina resort’s privately owned beach and is all about the good vibes. Serving Asian fusion cuisine, including tasty sesame chicken salad, glistening gyozas and the most superb salmon - the low-lit dining experience takes a buzzing turn by becoming an all-out party with the waiters creating the new atmosphere, handing out everything from tequila shots to sparklers and getting diners on their feet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ead227d83cc7-buddha-beach-z.jpg><p id=eAmYBZBae8CL data-wc=98>During the soiree, we saw a couple who appeared to be honeymooners clearly finding themselves out of their depth with the sudden party - but were up dancing with one another in no time, melting every woman on my table’s heart. To sum up, the restaurant is one of the most fun I’ve ever been to - as well as being wonderfully picturesque - and an absolute must-visit during your stay. However, when you lean slightly too close to a candle on a buddha statue and singe your hair, it might be time to call it a night.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecziiHLNH3xR data-wc=8><strong>Must try cocktail or dish: Sesame chicken salad&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Mykonos&nbsp;Social by&nbsp;Jason Atherton</h3><p id=e1CFb2z4RcEq data-wc=82>Wow. Wow. Wow. Could anything lunch have been more stunning that the one we enjoyed at the resort’s restaurant? The food was stunning, fresh and crisp with a Grecian tone. We especially loved the octopus salad, compressed fennel, bouillabaisse dressing, garlic, and parsley aioli and the burrata with Greek tomato and basil - and it is worth trying the Santa Marina chocolate rocks with Geranium ice for dessert. The menu was designed by the Michelin-starred chef for the perfect Mediterranean lunch. Dreamy!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/125f35d9e0ed-jason-restaurant-z.jpg><h3>BeefBar</h3><p id=e9UxCMp9jR__ data-wc=54>When I close my eyes, I still dream of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BeefBar</a>. The sun-soaked spot with straw shades, leafy trees and stony walls - and right by the beach - serves everything from street good to comfort grub - and after a big night of partying, was some of the most divine food I’ve ever had.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9b3d6cd3e7e8-beefbar.jpg><p id=epbSnzq9fErX data-wc=103>The waiters and sommelier couldn’t have been more attentive, and we tried the salmon, served on a streaming plate, alongside the fried veal, salty MVP snack of calamari crunch along with truffle fries which - as a table, we agreed for some of the best things we’ve ever had. Cat lovers will also enjoy a very well-fed fellow who came to say hello. While we almost skipped dessert over how much food we’d already enjoyed, we’re so glad we opted for what we thought would be a scoop of gelato. I won’t spoil the surprise - but be sure you try it out!&nbsp;</p><p id=ew37Mw8I-63w data-wc=7><strong>Must try cocktail or dish: Calamari crunch&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Zuma&nbsp;</h3><p id=etwVNgkKxQ5W data-wc=119>Perhaps the most recommended to us ahead of our visit to Mykonos, we knew that <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Zuma was an absolute must-visit&nbsp;</a>during a stay - and we were not disappointed. For those happy to pay a pretty penny for dinner - since Zuma is at the top price range - you will be getting your money’s worth for the sheer talent and effort that goes into your experience there from the moment you step instead. The Asian-fusion cuisine comes on impressive tiered plates, leaving you a little speechless and hardly knowing where to begin. Also, and we hate to be those people, but just WAIT until you see possibly the most incredible bathrooms ever to be built for a restaurant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dc5b826b1683-zuma-restaurant-z.jpg><h2><strong>BEST BEACH CLUBS TO VISIT IN&nbsp;MYKONOS</strong></h2><h3>Principote</h3><p id=eFLcrCVHp_T4 data-wc=57>With its shady brown and beige tones, cool vibes and lounge beds a few mere sandy footsteps away from the ocean (where, incidentally, a couple of yachts are moored up, their residents spending a day at the venue), <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Principote</a> is probably everything one could expect from a top tier Mykonos beach club - we certainly thought so.</p><p id=e4g-LcPu-oT1 data-wc=52>That being said, with cocktails starting at 30 Euros, your exuberance from the day might be stopped short by an eye-wateringly expensive bill - but everything is so luxurious it makes the high prices worth it - almost. Not to mention, we were served some of the best guacamole I’ve ever had.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/38d8e27954bb-principote-z.jpg><p id=eXX_Q3HdF_nR data-wc=52>The clientele is seriously glam, and I was relieved that we’d checked out the tagged page of the club’s Instagram to avoid showing up in flip-flops and an inflatable unicorn. The club is a place to be seen, with the dress code being dressy beachwear, if such a thing exists. Dress accordingly!&nbsp;</p><p id=eFbP2Ej6sToX data-wc=10><strong>Must-try cocktail or dish: Chicken tacos from Beach Bar menu</strong></p><h3>Jackie O’s&nbsp;</h3><p id=eiy99AiIG6oa data-wc=106>This fabulous beach club was a trip highlight.<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;With an exuberant atmosphere</a>, everyone is teeming with joy and keen to have the best possible time in the Super Paradise location - not to be confused with the restaurant in Old Town. An example of this was a bathroom trip, where I befriended a veteran of the beach club who loves it so much, he flew his family there for his birthday, and was visiting again to celebrate the closing of the season party. Within five minutes, he’d ordered me a cocktail named after him - so, should you visit, be sure to ask for the Marcel!&nbsp;</p><p id=eJqpCujBDL data-wc=9><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>10 Amazon travel must-haves for your next trip</a></strong></p><p id=eAqcav6yY8M7 data-wc=56>Jackie O’s also has a stunning restaurant area, where (after craving it for a couple of days) my friend and I had a sigh of happiness as we were served an incredible bowl of Cycladic carbonara pasta, as well as salmon with greens and apple slices, meatballs with bulgur pilaf and yoghurt sauce and watermelon salad.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEUGh8C7cZxO data-wc=9><strong>Must try cocktail or dish: Cycladic carbonara with louza&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Scorpios&nbsp;</h3><p id=eXQYf17vxOeR data-wc=103>Scorpios should be at the absolute top of your list during your visit. With a table being priced at £5,000, we’d suggest that just going, grabbing some drinks at the bar (prepare for a long wait) and taking to the thriving dance floor is fun enough without adding an unnecessary price tag. The music is pure house and the club is open until 4 am, in which case we suggest taking your party down to Old Town if you’re not ready for the night to be over where many a tacky but fun bar can be found open until the sun comes up.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2_jEociEF data-wc=17></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
