"But there was something I was hungering for that I didn't get from . That's the jazz musician in me that I'll never escape."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cullum isn't the only one finding nourishment in an old model. This month, Jose James, another young singer with one foot in jazz and the other outside it, will release , a gorgeously stripped-down set of tunes written by or closely associated with Billie Holiday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Timed to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Holiday's birth, follows James' 2014 album, , which dabbled in outsized guitars and dance grooves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2015/02/27/e782a048271349c4f2112b4c397418e3.jpg>Cullum and James join several other performers tending the jazz-vocal tradition, including Gregory Porter, whose won a Grammy Award last year, and the similarly acclaimed Cecile McLorin Salvant. Taken together, these artists' work suggests something encouraging about the durability - and also the adaptability - of the classic songbook.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I think we're seeing a renewed interest in good songs," says Don Was, president of Blue Note Records, home to Cullum, James and Porter. "And those older songs, they're really singer-friendly. That's why they keep coming back."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And "that's why you've got Bob Dylan singing them now," he adds with a laugh, referring to the just-released , on which Dylan improbably tackles songs once sung by Frank Sinatra.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Standards never really go out of style, of course; that's why they're called standards. And, as Was points out, their appeal attracts vocalists from all musical backgrounds - see Lady Gaga, who picked up a Grammy for her low-aiming album of duets with Tony Bennett.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Cullum and his ilk aren't just borrowing the music's prestige. As much as they're drawing sustenance from it, they're finding room to renovate as well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"As jazz musicians, we kind of have to mess around with this stuff," says Salvant, 25. "[Thelonius] Monk would play standards, but he'd totally take control of them. A melody that sounded so sweet and cute would end up sounding harsher and edgier in his hands."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The daughter of a French mother and a Haitian father, Salvant grew up in Miami studying classical voice; after high school, she moved to France, where she discovered jazz.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There's a theatrical quality to her singing on , her Grammy-nominated 2013 album, that sets it apart. You can hear her inhabiting the characters in the songs, thinking about their actions and motivations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And the selections reveal an academic streak. Along with familiar tunes such as and , Salvant sings curios such as , an eyebrow-raising song from the early 1930s about hearing "primitive love cries" in "the tropic heat".</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">There was something I was hungering for â€¦ Thatâ€™s the jazz musician in me that Iâ€™ll never escapeJAMIE CULLUM</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I play for a lot of audiences that know jazz well," she says. "Sometimes I like to choose songs they don't know."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On , James brings his soulful rasp and behind-the-beat phrasing to nine of Holiday's signature songs, including and , which opens with James overdubbing his voice into a ghostly choir. (Cassandra Wilson, the reliably adventurous jazz veteran, will release her Holiday tribute in April.) And then there's Cullum, who moves through his album's title track - made famous when Sarah Vaughan sang lyrics to the Dizzy Gillespie tune later known as - with a sense of modern mischief. Like Salvant, Cullum also seems interested in expanding our notion of what a standard is.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beyond the established jazz fare, has renditions of Randy Newman's , Ray Charles' and by indie-folk songwriter Sufjan Stevens. He and Porter join forces, as well, for a rollicking .</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Part of what enables these singers to take the liberties they do is the charisma they emit, a magnetic pull that gives them something of a pop-star vibe even as they look away from the sound of pop. During a gig recently at Largo in Los Angeles, for instance, Cullum earned a standing ovation with his opening number. And it's that audience connection that makes him a good fit for an exponentially larger venue like the Hollywood Bowl, where he'll play on August 5, says Laura Connelly, the Bowl's director of presentations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Jamie has this firecracker enthusiasm for what he's singing. That's somewhat rare in jazz, which can be a little serious," she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cullum says he's experienced moments of unease regarding his celebrity, which in Britain approaches pop-star level. He's married to English writer and model Sophie Dahl, and he hosts a popular jazz-leaning BBC radio show every week. "It's hard to know sometimes where that stuff should sit," he says of his offstage pursuits. "People might think I'm winding down as a musician."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ultimately, though, his high profile only brings more attention to the classic songs he wants to expose, he says. And in that regard Cullum tips his hat to the singer who's probably done more than anyone else today to keep the standards alive, even if he's not widely embraced by the jazz realm that seeks to revisit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I think Michael Buble has done the world a lot of favours in putting this music back on the map," Cullum says of the crooner beloved by millions for his easy-listening approach. "That's been good for the repertoire. I'm sure that's the kind of thing jazz musicians aren't supposed to say. But I don't agree."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: How to keep up standards</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHKDkW1vbmxfl7%2BqwMisn2armaO0pr6Mo5imoZVisLa4y66kZqSRqbK0wIyer6mkn6eybrbAs7Fmq6SWu6Wt0Z2q</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbritish-singer-jamie-cullum-latest-explore-jazz-standards.html&text=British%20singer%20Jamie%20Cullum%20the%20latest%20to%20explore%20jazz%20standards&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritish-singer-jamie-cullum-latest-explore-jazz-standards.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritish-singer-jamie-cullum-latest-explore-jazz-standards.html&title=British%20singer%20Jamie%20Cullum%20the%20latest%20to%20explore%20jazz%20standards" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbritish-singer-jamie-cullum-latest-explore-jazz-standards.html&title=British%20singer%20Jamie%20Cullum%20the%20latest%20to%20explore%20jazz%20standards" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbritish-singer-jamie-cullum-latest-explore-jazz-standards.html&title=British%20singer%20Jamie%20Cullum%20the%20latest%20to%20explore%20jazz%20standards" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritish-singer-jamie-cullum-latest-explore-jazz-standards.html&description=British%20singer%20Jamie%20Cullum%20the%20latest%20to%20explore%20jazz%20standards" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./even-ugly-schmucks-need-love-dating-apps-people-seeking-clowns-mullets-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Even 'ugly schmucks' need love: dating apps for people seeking everything from clowns to mullets">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./black-bottom-cupcakes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="black-bottom cupcakes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
