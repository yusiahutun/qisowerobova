Donald and Melania’s son, Barron Trump, recently caught attention from fans over his height, towering above his parents.</strong></p><p>The 17-year-old is no stranger to public attention. His dad Donald is a billionaire who increased his fortune in the <a href=#>real estate</a> world. The businessman owned and managed hotels, casinos and gold resorts around the world. He even invented Trump University, which offered classes in real estate modules for five years between 2005 and 2010. He was also a reality <a href=#>TV</a> star, with the show The Apprentice running for 14 years. Melania, Barron’s mother, was a <a href=#>famous model</a> before meeting the business mogul. Therefore, his youngest, Barron Trump, knows all too well the life in the spotlight.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-barron-trump-s-height-is-down-to-his-grandmother>Barron Trump’s height is down to his ‘grandmother’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1410059415-1024x854.jpg><p>Melania Trump paid an emotional tribute to her mother, Amalija Knav, <a href=#>last week following her death</a>. It came after she was reportedly suffering ill health over the Christmas period, with the former First Lady rushing to her bedside.</p><p>After the sad news of her death, her funeral took place yesterday, January 18.</p><p>During the affairs, 17-year-old Barron was seen comforting his father as they attended the service in Florida. Barron, whose height towers over his dad <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>, reached over to extend a hand to the former POTUS.</p><p>Donald has spoken about his son’s growth spurt before. A few days ago, Trump said at a campaign rally that Barron’s height was down to his late mother-in-law.</p><p>He told the crowd of his mother-in-law’s Eastern European cuisine: “That’s how he got so tall, he only ate her food.” The crowd laughed as Trump also said, despite Barron’s height, the kid preferred soccer to basketball.</p><p>The 77-year-old continued: &nbsp;“I said you’re gonna be a basketball player. He said, ‘well, I like soccer dad, actually.’ But you can’t talk them into everything!”</p><p>He then called his son, who stands at 6 foot 7, a “special boy”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-barron-comforts-his-father-at-grandmother-s-funeral>Barron comforts his father at grandmother’s funeral</h2><p>Although Donald Trump is eyeing up the presidency for 2024, the family have taken time out of the campaign trail during this emotional time.</p><p>Body language expert Judi James <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> The Mirror the comforting gesture from Barron was “unusual”.</p><p>She said it was different from the typical ‘stoic’ family. Judi explained: “Clearly tuned into his father’s mood, he extends a hand in what looks like a mimed or truncated embrace that could suggest a desire to show comfort and/or support.”</p><p>She added: “This is an unusual display of emotion from Trump, who appears to be mourning Melania’s mother as a personal loss.”</p><p>Later, Judi says in images of Trump and Melania together, Donald appears “more vulnerable than usual”.</p><p>The former Apprentice star also praised Amalijia in his victory speech in Iowa.</p><p>He said: “Great people, great parents to all of us, really. Great parents, but also to Barron. Boy, did she take care of Barron.”</p><p>The teenager was also taught to speak Slovenian by his grandparents, and he began learning as a child.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aGcLDOp5ilnF2pv7a5z6xkpqeknbKzecinZKWZp2K2tHnTqGSbpJGism6yzqtkrKeeYq%2BivtGopaxlmJq2qLTTaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdonald-trumps-mother-in-law-is-to-blame-for-son-barrons-height.html&text=Donald%20Trump%27s%20mother-in-law%20is%20to%20%27blame%27%20for%20son%20Barron%27s%20height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdonald-trumps-mother-in-law-is-to-blame-for-son-barrons-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-trumps-mother-in-law-is-to-blame-for-son-barrons-height.html&title=Donald%20Trump%27s%20mother-in-law%20is%20to%20%27blame%27%20for%20son%20Barron%27s%20height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdonald-trumps-mother-in-law-is-to-blame-for-son-barrons-height.html&title=Donald%20Trump%27s%20mother-in-law%20is%20to%20%27blame%27%20for%20son%20Barron%27s%20height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-trumps-mother-in-law-is-to-blame-for-son-barrons-height.html&title=Donald%20Trump%27s%20mother-in-law%20is%20to%20%27blame%27%20for%20son%20Barron%27s%20height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdonald-trumps-mother-in-law-is-to-blame-for-son-barrons-height.html&description=Donald%20Trump%27s%20mother-in-law%20is%20to%20%27blame%27%20for%20son%20Barron%27s%20height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./406126-helb-bursary-requirements-application-forms-disbursement-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="HELB bursary: Requirements, application, forms, disbursement">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pacifica-dreamy-youth-face-cream-amazon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Best Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin Is Pacifica Dreamy Youth Face Cream">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
