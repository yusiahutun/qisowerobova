The building&nbsp;was originally constructed in 1927 for the International Harvester Company for their first truck sales and service facility.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/Bowstring3.jpg><p>Previous to International Harvester Trucks, the&nbsp;site was developed as an apartment building by Celestine Fejervary (one of the donors of Fejevary Park in west Davenport), a daughter of a Hungarian nobleman who moved to Davenport in 1853.</p><p>It’s now called Bowstring Lofts because early on, Nielsen learned from their architect, Andrew Dasso (Streamline Architects of East Moline) that the arched steel roof support structure, trusses, are known&nbsp;as “Bowstring Trusses.” They are used in buildings and bridges to span longer distances. They were configuring two-level lofted apartments built up into the bowstring trusses, so “Bowstring Lofts” seemed appropriate, Nielsen said.</p><p>Much shorter than the official&nbsp;name on the National Register of Historic Places application — International Harvester Truck Sales and Service Station, he noted.</p><p>For more information on the Bowstring property manager, <a href=#>click HERE</a>.</p><p>Bucktown Lofts. 225 E. 2nd St., is being totally rehabbed from its former home as Bucktown Center for the Arts, which used to house art galleries and studios on the first two levels and condominiums on the upper levels. Formerly co-owned by MidCoast Fine Arts, the art spaces closed in early 2020 after the nonprofit MidCoast disbanded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/Bucktown_Center.jpg><p>The Bucktown building was built in 1910 as the J.F. Kelly wholesale grocery warehouse, on the site of the famous Brick Munro’s Pavilion and Summer Garden.</p><p>Bucktown was one of Davenport’s most colorful districts, especially in the late 19th century and early 20th century. “From dozens of brothels and speakeasies, to manufacturing, distribution, automotive and retail, Bucktown has played many roles in downtown’s development,” says a history of the building from developer Y&J Properties.</p><p>The building is entirely vacant and being redeveloped for a variety of 21 apartments – ranging from 570-1,310-square-foot, one-bedrooms; to 1,160 and 1,233-square-foot two-bedrooms; and one 1,650-square-foot three-bedroom – with rents ranging from $925 to $2,250 a month. Seven ground-floor commercial units will range from 160 to 2,000 square feet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/Motor-R4.jpg><p>Bucktown amenities will include most with riverfront views, high ceilings, open floor plans, in-unit washer/dryer, stainless steel appliances, smart locks and access for extra security.</p><p>Developer Neil Girish Desai said recently they hope to complete the project by late summer 2024. For more information on this property manager, <a href=#>click HERE</a>.</p><p>“For commercial, we are looking to bring back the community-centric focus of the old Bucktown building by making it a haven for small businesses, driven by experiences, services, and retail,” he said.</p><p>“Second Street and the Motor Row District has grown so much with restaurants, nightlife, experiences, and much more. We want to double down on this by bringing back the great history of Bucktown’s retail / services that existed in the 2000s and 2010s and make this the heartbeat of downtown Davenport,” Desai said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/01/Motor-R11-rotated.jpg><p>“We have partnered with Greenstar Construction to complete this historic renovation. They’ve been a great partner to us in restoring historical buildings in downtown Davenport and Burlington,” he added.</p><p>“Even though costs are going up, we are bullish on the future of downtown Davenport and want to continue to invest in the people and the community,” Desai said.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on downtown Davenport, <a href=#>click HERE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKSoqpVirrGt0a2knqakqHqku8yeZK2nXZm8uLrTqK6nZZSWw6a6z6iprWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmore-apartments-come-to-downtown-davenport.html&text=More%20apartments%20come%20to%20downtown%20Davenport&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmore-apartments-come-to-downtown-davenport.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmore-apartments-come-to-downtown-davenport.html&title=More%20apartments%20come%20to%20downtown%20Davenport" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmore-apartments-come-to-downtown-davenport.html&title=More%20apartments%20come%20to%20downtown%20Davenport" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmore-apartments-come-to-downtown-davenport.html&title=More%20apartments%20come%20to%20downtown%20Davenport" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmore-apartments-come-to-downtown-davenport.html&description=More%20apartments%20come%20to%20downtown%20Davenport" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./prince-william-kate-middleton-full-wedding-menu-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding menu paid tribute to Prince Charles">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mac-boom-boom-bloom.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mac Boom Boom Bloom is a Cherry Blossom Explosion">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
