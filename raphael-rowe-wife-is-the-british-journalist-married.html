With journalist and ex-convicts, Raphael Rowe once again decided to immerse himself in the daily challenges of prison life and larger issues of human rights on an international scale. For this four-episode season, Raphael and his team are said to travel to Moldova, Cyprus, Bosnia, and Greece.</p><p>That being said, we now shall tell you all about Raphael’s wife, his parents, his net worth, and more.</p><h3><strong>Raphael Rowe Wife: Is The British Journalist Married?</strong></h3><p>So basically, as of 2022, Raphael Rowe had not gotten all the stories (of his personal life) out. Yet, he did reveal in his memoir Notorious that he is married and has kids. About this, he himself talked to The Hollywood Reporter that he had never talked about his wife and children anywhere, before this. So, even in his book, it is the first time that he revealed that he is even married.</p><p>By now, most of you should be aware of Raphael’s background about how he once spent 12 years in a maximum security prison for crimes he did not commit. So, let us also tell you that, he was the father to a baby boy when he was jailed.</p><p>All that time Raphael was in a high-security prison, he dreamed of one day getting to know his son. This is the oldest child we are talking about (he was 12 in 2000).</p><p>Luckily, for his youngest son and daughter, Raphael was able to explain his imprisonment. He shared that he did so by showing them a scrapbook of all the press clippings about his wrongful conviction.</p><p>Before imprisonment, Raphael had a girlfriend named Nancy Stanley.</p><p>Rowe had been dating a woman prior to being incarcerated. He said later that they got back in contact two months after his release and had their first child in the summer of 2004. So, probably she is his wife. His oldest son has Down syndrome and he is from a previous relationship.</p><h3><strong>Raphael Rowe Parents</strong></h3><p>Raphael Rowe was born on 11 March 1970 to a Jamaican father (Raphael Rowe Sr.) and a British mother (Rosemary Prior). He grew up in southeast London, along with his three sisters.</p><p>His father emigrated from Jamaica at the age of 26. And when Rosemary was only 17, they met and got married. Soon after, their first daughter, Belinda was born. They went on to have two more daughters, Hazel and Joanna before Raphael junior was born.</p><p>Growing up, Rapahel was expelled from secondary school due to his lack of attention and general bad behavior. Because his parents could not afford to give him the things he wanted, he started looking for ways to get them. So, at 17 he was arrested for burglary and spent 10 months in a Young Offenders Institute.</p><p>Then, once released, he was back home with his parents and they tried to get him back on the straight and narrow. Despite this, Raphael continued to be rebellious and on 19 December 1988, his world turned upside down when he was arrested for a gruesome murder and robbery.</p><p>Now, looking back, Raphael believes he would still be a wrongly convicted prisoner and his family and he would still be campaigning to prove his innocence, had it not been for legal aid.</p><h3><strong>Did Raphael Rowe Sue?</strong></h3><p>Back in 1999, when still fighting to clear his name for the murderous crime spree sued the Home Office for an alleged attack at Wormwood Scrubs.</p><p>Raphael had his case referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and had reported that he was attacked and racially abused inside a segregation unit of the west London jail where he was transferred awaiting his first appeal in 1993. He was thus demanding an apology and damages for his injuries and the humiliation, distress, and anxiety caused to him by the assault.</p><h3><strong>Raphael Rowe Compensation</strong></h3><p>Back in those days, Raphael Rowe also adamantly kept protesting his innocence and was determined to seek compensation for the lost years.</p><p>But fast forward to now, and it was still not known how much he received. Yet we know he was paid £10,300 by the Daily Mail which had launched an appeal for information.</p><p>Raphael went into prison as a 20-year-old boy and left as a 32-year-old man. Upon release, he took a year off, traveling the world and catching up on the life that he had missed, and finally decided to pursue a career in journalism. So, adding to what he had learned about justice in prison, he studied journalism and then joined the BBC. He thus started his career as an investigative journalist as a reporter on BBC Radio 4.</p><p>Then, in 2016, he went freelance and started hosting the Netflix documentary Inside The World’s Toughest Prisons from series 2. All along, he continued working with the BBC by reporting on the “One Show” and “Sunday Morning Live”.</p><p>Of course, Raphael also devoted his time to helping other victims. He launched a podcast called Second Chances just to talk to people about their second chances.</p><h3><strong>Raphael Rowe’s Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Raphael Rowe was reportedly standing at over £541,000 net worth as of 2022.</p><p>According to PayScale, a BBC employee makes an average of £36K a year. So, Raphael also should have earned more or less that amount.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Raphael Rowe?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Raphael Rowe with a “Greek god” type of physique, stands 5’8” in height.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Does Raphael Rowe Live Today?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Raphael Rowe continued to dwell around his hometown of London, United Kingdom as of 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Are The Shows Starring Raphael Rowe?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Before starring in&nbsp;Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons&nbsp;in 2016, Raphael did a few other TV shows.</p><p>He first appeared in the 5 September 2006-dated episode of TV series called Breakfast, another TV series documentary Timeshift in 2011, served as a correspondent on the current affairs in the series Panorama&nbsp;from 2009 through 2014, in the TV series documentary Pilgrimage and The Catch podcast series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmq5mgna6muIyrprCdXay2p7GMoqpmrJiaeqO%2ByK2grKBdn7y2vs2ao6KrpGK6or7RopydZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fraphael-rowe-wife-is-the-british-journalist-married.html&text=Is%20The%20British%20Journalist%20Married%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fraphael-rowe-wife-is-the-british-journalist-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fraphael-rowe-wife-is-the-british-journalist-married.html&title=Is%20The%20British%20Journalist%20Married%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fraphael-rowe-wife-is-the-british-journalist-married.html&title=Is%20The%20British%20Journalist%20Married%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fraphael-rowe-wife-is-the-british-journalist-married.html&title=Is%20The%20British%20Journalist%20Married%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fraphael-rowe-wife-is-the-british-journalist-married.html&description=Is%20The%20British%20Journalist%20Married%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./skeletal-remains-identified-missing-mother-five-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Skeletal remains identified as missing Esmeralda Pargas">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./madewell-harlow-wide-leg-pant-review-8609907.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I Sat on a 5 Hour Flight in These Comfortable, Petite-Friendly Pants">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
