Not her own, of course – a string of hit movies including Groundhog Day and Four Weddings And A Funeral have firmly established her career – but she wonders what’s in store for her two aspiring actress daughters.<br></span></p><p><span>‘Like all young girls wanting to make their mark in Hollywood, they’re having to handle pressure to go nude on screen,’ she says. ‘They want to be taken seriously, and they’re not crazy about the idea of having to take their clothes off.</span><br></p><p><span>‘So they call me to ask my advice. I’d never tell them what to do, but I do say that if nude scenes were what it took to become an actress when I started, I probably wouldn’t have done it. Nudity is expected by the studios these days, and I think that’s appalling.<br></span></p><img id=i-5d9d0d47 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/06/article-0-1B311FBF00000578-743_634x686.jpg height=686 width=634 alt="Andie MacDowell, who shot to fame in Groundhog Day and Four Weddings And A Funeral, has been advising her aspiring actress daughters about Hollywood" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Andie MacDowell, who shot to fame in Groundhog Day and Four Weddings And A Funeral, has been advising her aspiring actress daughters about Hollywood</p><p><span>'It wasn’t taken for granted in my early days, and you never saw respected actresses showing their boobs. You were more respected as an actor when you didn’t. It almost lowered your status if you did.</span><br></p><p><span>‘I certainly didn’t, and if a nude scene was required I always had a body double. Even when Playboy offered me a lot of money to pose for them in the 1980s I wouldn’t do it. Now, in the movies, not only are young actresses – and actors – having to do naked scenes, but they’re filmed having sex. I have a problem with anyone having to do pornography. My question is, how far is all this going? What’s next? The truth is, I’m bored with it and I think other people are as well. Yet since when is sex supposed to be boring?’</span><br></p><p><span>Andie has always been surrounded by women. The youngest of four girls born in Gaffney, South Carolina, to a music teacher mother and a father who was a lumber yard executive, one of her earliest memories is of wanting to act and playing ‘pretend’ games with her sisters because money was tight and the family couldn’t afford the cinema.<br></span></p><p><span>Her parents’ marriage was unhappy, and when her father left home when she was six her mother Paula descended into alcoholism. ‘She never recovered from my father leaving. Shame was her downfall.’</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/06/article-2553016-1B311C1700000578-307_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>My haven: Angie Best, the former wife of footballer George,...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/06/article-2553036-1B3E48DE00000578-233_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>As they prepare to dance the Bolero for the last time - 30...</span></a></li><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/06/article-2553054-1B3E3B0B00000578-121_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Stephen McGann reveals how his Call The Midwife storyline is...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p><span>The young Andie was devastated by the disintegration of her family. Aged just 20 and desperate to act she fled to New York with just £700 to her name, and signed for Elite Model Management in 1978.</span><br><span>Three years later Paula died of an alcohol-related illness.</span></p><p><span>She was 53; Andie 23. Not long after, Andie married model Paul Qualley whom she’d met on a Gap shoot, and they had son Justin and daughters Rainey and Margaret.

Andie played wealthy American Carrie who bumps into Hugh Grant's debonair but gaffe-prone Brit Charles</p><p><span>By the time she married, Andie had won her first film role, as Jane in 1984’s Greystoke: The Legend Of Tarzan. On screen she looked sensational but her southern drawl was infamously dubbed by Glenn Close in a humiliation which might have stalled the career of a less determined actress.<br></span></p><p><span>Rather than retreat into motherhood she insisted on proving her critics wrong by taking acting classes and going on to make a string of successful films beginning with Sex, Lies And Videotape.</span><br></p><p><span>The film that made her name, though, was the phenomenally successful rom-com Four Weddings And A Funeral in 1994. Andie played wealthy American Carrie who bumps into Hugh Grant’s debonair but gaffe-prone Brit Charles at a succession of weddings, and when they spend the night together she memorably teases him by suggesting they’ll now have to get married.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>While Andie tried to reconcile her ambition with her instinct to nurture, Qualley stayed at home with the children. But in 1999, after 13 years of marriage, the pair divorced. Andie returned home to South Carolina with her children, saying she’d carried the scars of her own parents’ divorce into her marriage.<br></span></p><p><span>‘I moved back home because I realised life was going by and I didn’t want to miss out on time with my sisters and their kids and my own children. But I was 40 and there was a slight panic along the lines of, “What am I supposed to do now?” I was single and dating. Dating is a weird experience at any age.’</span><br></p><p><span>She met up with an old friend, jewellery businessman Rhett Hartzog – who’d had a youthful crush on her – and they married in 2001, but divorced three years later, Andie admitting she’d wed on the rebound. Single now – though rarely without an admirer in tow – Andie has been concentrating on her family, two of whom have taken their first steps on the Hollywood ladder.<br></span></p><p><span>Rainey, 24, has made three films – the 2012 tear-jerker Mighty Fine, and Falcon Song and Mother’s Day, both due out in May – while 18-year-old Margaret is taking drama lessons, modelling and has a part in a pilot for US series The Leftovers.</span><br></p><p><span>‘I wasn’t happy at first when the girls told me they wanted to take up acting,’ admits Andie. ‘I tried to talk them into doing something less stressful but they were determined, so I’ve tried to offer them advice without interfering. They know what I think about nudity – it shouldn’t be necessary – and they agree with me. If they ask me what I think about something I run through all the options, but I don’t force an opinion on them. The one thing I have tried to prepare them for is rejection. You get a lot of that in acting and it’s not easy. But if I didn’t think they were good, I’d be trying to get them to do something else.’</span></p><img id=i-aab90e85 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/06/article-2553064-18DE5616000005DC-935_634x934.jpg height=934 width=634 alt="Andie with 23-year-old Rainey, who has made three films - Mighty Fine, and Falcon Song and Mother's Day, both due out in May" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Andie with 23-year-old Rainey, who has made three films - Mighty Fine, and Falcon Song and Mother's Day, both due out in May</p><p><span>Andie’s 27-year-old son Justin is the only one of her offspring not bitten by the bug. ‘He wants to teach kids, play basketball, have a beer and lead a normal life. That’s what he’s looking for. Acting is not a normal life.’</span><br></p><p><span>Andie is wearing a tight red dress which shows off her stunning figure, and her hair tumbles to her shoulders. Her skin is still flawless – she’s held a contract with L’Oréal for 25 years now.&nbsp; She sees herself as a champion for older women, and says that at 55 she’s never felt sexier.<br></span></p><p><span>‘For years men have been allowed to get older and sexier and they’ve traded us in for younger girls. In reality, women are no different. I think there’s a beauty to every age. Meryl Streep and Glenn Close are beautiful. I think Susan Sarandon is as well.’</span><br></p><p><span>If she’s under pressure to maintain her looks, she doesn’t feel it. ‘I take really good care of myself. I work out and diet and I love to hike. I want to be healthy and enjoy my life. I don’t want to not be able to do the things I love to do. In other words I’m saying it’s not just vanity.’</span><br></p><img id=i-a8400e66 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/06/article-2553064-005AC63C00000258-890_306x557.jpg height=557 width=306 alt="Groundhog Day, the 1993 film starring Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Groundhog Day, the 1993 film starring Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray</p><p><span>She’s about to be seen on TV here in a successful US drama series Cedar Cove, based on a bestseller by Debbie Macomber, in which she stars as local judge Olivia Lockhart. Andie’s character is a single mother who falls in love with a journalist played by Canadian actor Dylan Neal, recently seen opposite Val Kilmer in thriller The Traveler.<br></span></p><p><span>Although the action is set in the US north-west, most of the action is filmed around Vancouver in gruelling 14-hour days. At first Andie wasn’t sure she wanted to take the role. ‘My children have always been my priority, and Margaret was still at school. She was my last, and when you get down to the end of childhood in a mothering role, it’s a very valuable experience. But Margaret said, “I don’t want to stop you doing this.”’</span><br></p><p><span>Olivia is the moral centre of the&nbsp; coastal community, pedalling through town with flowers in her bicycle basket and a chiffon scarf trailing as she passes judgements with sense and tact. Andie was attracted to the gentleness of the show.<br></span></p><p><span>‘One of the reasons I was excited about doing it was because when I went to work every day I was going to be in a warm place. It’s wholesome: there’s no profanity in our series, it’s uplifting. There’s nothing much else out there on TV apart from reality shows, which I can’t watch. I’m so tired of them.’</span><br></p><p><span>Critics have described the feel-good series as ‘a burst of sunshine’ and Andie’s own life, she says, is no different: settled and homespun – despite the challenges.<br></span></p><p><span>‘I think the idea of having it all is funny. Like every woman with a career, I’ve had to make sacrifices. I had to leave my children to accept roles. It hurts. And I think men are becoming more like women in the way they’re having more of a role with their kids – and that can only be a good thing. Women are stronger, too.’</span><br></p><p><span>Andie’s own steely centre is often perceived as a fault. ‘People say I’m intimidating, but I know at my core who I am,’ she adds. ‘I was fearless and driven by my creativity. And I’m still that person. But really I’m just like anybody else. I have feelings, insecurities, pains, hurts and fears. The one great thing that’s happened for me is that I’ve had huge success in the movie business – it rarely happens. So now I can think, “OK, you don’t have to kill yourself, you can enjoy where you are and still be creative.”</span><br></p><p><span>‘I was certainly crazier when I was younger. I had more freedom and less responsibility. I grew up in a house full of women. I vividly remember the freedom of being naked, because we didn’t have any guys around after my parents divorced.’ She now wishes she’d kept more of that free spirit. ‘I also wish I’d appreciated that we as women had more choice than ever before.
