While he is known for playing the role of a fictional boxer in ‘Rocky’, only a few people know that he is actually very well trained in the sport.</p><p>Moreover, even while shooting his movies, Stallone would invite professional boxers to train with him. According to him, this would entice the audience, as an element of realism could then be portrayed in the movies. However, these training sessions sometimes ended very badly for the oscar-nominated actor. In an interview, Stallone revealed that he once invited former lightweight champion and boxing legend, Roberto Duran, to spar with him during the production of Rocky 2.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Sylvester Stallone details a sparring session with Roberto Duran</h2><p>He stated that at first sight; it seemed an interesting matchup for him, as Duran was the much smaller man. However, he would then realize the difference in the level between him and ‘Hands of Stone”</p><p>“I actually have been in the ring in a fashion with Roberto Duran. He was in Rocky 2 and he’s supposedly Rocky’s sparring partner. At first I thought this will be pretty interesting because you know I was a few pounds heavier and a little taller and then I realized the difference between an amateur and a consummate pro.” he said.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-boxing-news-a-very-foolhardy-hazardous-and-homicidal-concept-sylvester-stallone-was-left-with-six-stitches-due-to-sparring-session-with-one-of-the-most-punishing-fighters-that-ever-l?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Rocky-Balboa-1024x513-1-560x281.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">‘A Very Foolhardy, Hazardous, and Homicidal Concept’: Sylvester Stallone Was Left With Six Stitches Due to Sparring Session With ‘One of the Most Punishing Fighters That Ever Lived’ for Rocky Movie</p></a><p>Moreover, he even praised Duran for his head movement and claimed that he could end the fight in 11 seconds, including the 10-count. “The way he could move his head just an inch its impossible to hit him. This man would demolish me in 11 seconds, including the count.” he wrote.</p><p>Duran is considered to be one of the greatest pound-for-pound fighters to ever grace the sport. His rivalry <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>against</a> Sugar Ray Leonard is still one of the best in the sport, even to this day. Thus, it was no surprise that Stallone had a hard time sparring with the legend.</p><p>What did you think about Stallone’s one-off sparring session with Duran?
