There's no [expletive] point in that, I'm not doing it."&nbsp;</p><p id=eZ1_GueksC data-wc=23>Megan admitted that there are many procedures she hasn't done because of her fear of being put to sleep on the operating table.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNV15S_J7e data-wc=27>"I'm very afraid of dying under general anaesthesia," she confessed.
